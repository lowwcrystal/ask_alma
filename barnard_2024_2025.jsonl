They are an\ninvitation — from Barnard to you — to shape your own academic\njourney. You will encounter a diverse range of perspectives throughout\nyour time here. Nowhere is that more evident than in our course\ncatalog. \nYou’ll see opportunities to join lectures with professors who are\nthe world’s foremost experts in their ﬁelds. You’ll read about small\nseminars that give you the chance to have deep discussions with\nyour peers and instructors. Every course you take will challenge your\nthinking and expand your world. \nKnow that there are no wrong answers. There is no “perfect” path\nto uncover. And always remember: The beauty and flexibility of a\nBarnard education lie in the hundreds of options and thousands of\npermutations before you right now. \nTake risks. Be uncomfortable. Enroll in a course about something\nyou’ve always been fascinated by and another about a topic you’ve\nnever thought about. Consider a course that will give you room to\nconfront ideas that will stretch your mind. \nYou never know what you may discover. \nFinally: Take your time. Revel in this experience and let your mind\nwander to the possibilities in front of you.

{"page_index": 4, "page_content": "4  The College\nTHE COLLEGE\nBarnard College has been a distinguished leader in higher education\nfor women for over 135 years and is today the most sought after\nprivate liberal arts college for women in the nation.  Founded in 1889,\nBarnard was the only college in New York City, and one of the few in the\nnation, where women could receive the same rigorous and challenging\neducation available to men. Its partnership with Columbia University,\ncombined with its setting in a global city, its strength in STEM, and its\nunwavering dedication to the advancement of women, makes Barnard\nunique among liberal arts colleges today.\nBarnard is both an independently accredited and incorporated\neducational institution as well as an ofﬁcial college of Columbia\nUniversity—a combination that simultaneously affords it self-\ndetermination and a rich, value-enhancing partnership.  Whether\nthey are taking classes that are rarely available at small liberal arts\ncolleges or competing in Division I athletics through the Barnard-\nColumbia Athletic Consortium, Barnard students make the most of the\nUniversity’s myriad academic and extracurricular resources. Columbia\nstudents also beneﬁt from their association with Barnard; for example,\nthey may major or minor in subjects–such as Dance, Architecture, and\nTheatre–which are not offered by Columbia College.\nFrom the heights of upper Manhattan to the canyons of Wall Stree,\nNew York City serves as a natural extension of the Barnard campus;\nas a site of exploration, a laboratory for experimentation, and an\nobject of investigation in its own right, the city is fully integrated into\nthe curriculum across the disciplines. Beyond academics, Barnard’s\nrobust internship programs allow students to take advantage of\nthe city's unparalleled wealth of cultural, social, and professional\nopportunities.\nThe College draws accomplished, motivated, bright, and curious young\nwomen who seek a stimulating atmosphere and diverse community.\nBarnard alumnae include pioneers like anthropologist Margaret Mead\nand Judith Kaye, the ﬁrst female Chief Judge of the State of New York,\nalong with prominent cultural ﬁgures such as choreographer Twyla\nTharp; writers Zora Neale Hurston, Mary Gordon, and Jhumpa Lahiri;\navant-garde multimedia artist Laurie Anderson; Pulitzer Prize-winning\njournalists Anna Quindlen and Natalie Angier; and actor, screenwriter,\nand director Greta Gerwig.\nMission Statement\nBarnard College aims to provide the highest quality liberal arts\neducation to promising and high-achieving young women, offering\nthe unparalleled advantages of an outstanding residential college\nin partnership with a major research university. With a dedicated\nfaculty of scholars distinguished in their respective ﬁelds, Barnard\nis a community of accessible teachers and engaged students who\nparticipate together in intellectual risk-taking and discovery. Barnard\nstudents develop the intellectual resources to take advantage of\nopportunities as new ﬁelds, new ideas, and new technologies emerge.\nThey graduate prepared to lead lives that are professionally satisfying\nand successful, personally fulﬁlling, and enriched by love of learning.\nAs a college for women, Barnard embraces its responsibility to address\nissues of gender in all of their complexity and urgency, and to help\nstudents achieve the personal strength that will enable them to meet\nthe challenges they will encounter throughout their lives. Located in\nthe cosmopolitan urban environment of New York City, and committed\nto diversity in its student body, faculty and staff, Barnard prepares\nits graduates to flourish in different cultural surroundings in an\nincreasingly inter-connected world.\nThe Barnard community thrives on high expectations. By setting\nrigorous academic standards and giving students the support they\nneed to meet those standards, Barnard enables them to discover\ntheir own capabilities. Living and learning in this unique environment,\nBarnard students become agile, resilient, responsible, and creative,\nprepared to lead and serve their society.\nBarnard History\nBarnard College was among the pioneers in the late 19th-century\ncrusade to make higher education available to young women.\nThe College grew out of the idea, ﬁrst proposed by Columbia\nUniversity’s tenth president, Frederick A.P. Barnard, that women have an\nopportunity for higher education at Columbia. Initially ignored, the idea\nled to the creation of a “Collegiate Course for Women.” Although highly-\nqualiﬁed women were authorized to follow a prescribed course of study\nleading ultimately to Columbia University degrees, no provision was\nmade for where and how they were to pursue their studies. It was six\nyears before Columbia’s trustees agreed to the establishment of a\ncollege for women. A provisional charter was secured, and Barnard\nCollege was named in honor of its most persistent advocate.\nIn October 1889, the ﬁrst Barnard class met in a rented brownstone at\n343 Madison Avenue. Fourteen students enrolled in the School of Arts\nand twenty-two “specials,” lacking the entrance requirements in Greek,\nenrolled in science. There was a faculty of six.\nNine years later Barnard moved to its present site in Morningside\nHeights. In 1900, Barnard was included in the educational system\nof Columbia University with provisions unique among women’s\ncolleges: it was governed by its own Trustees, Faculty, and Dean, and\nwas responsible for its own endowment and facilities, while sharing\ninstruction, the library, and the degree of the University.\nBarnard Today\nFrom the original 14 students, enrollment has grown to over 3,000, with\nover 46,700 awarded degrees since 1893. The integration of teaching\nand scholarship occurs at an incomparable level at Barnard. Barnard's\nfaculty of 259 women and men are teacher-scholars whose paramount\nconcern is the education of undergraduate students and whose\nprofessional achievements bring added vitality to the classroom. This\ncommitment to personal attention and high achievement provide the\nultimate learning environment.\nBarnard’s liberal arts education is broad in scope and demanding. The\ncurriculum includes a series of general education requirements—a\nprogram of courses the faculty believes provides a stimulating and\nthorough education, while remaining flexible and varied enough to suit\na student’s own interests, strengths, and talents. Classes vary in size.\nThose in which student participation is important are small. There are\nopportunities for independent study and students are often invited to\nwork on research projects with faculty members.\nIn 2007, Barnard College and Columbia University amended and\nextended the longstanding agreement for cooperation between the\ninstitutions, an agreement which remains unique in higher education.\nBarnard stands as an independent college for women with its own\ncurriculum, faculty, admissions standards, graduation requirements,", "source": "pdfs/barnard 2024-2025.pdf"}

At the same time, Barnard\nand Columbia share resources, thereby giving students open access\nto the courses, facilities, and libraries of both schools. Barnard\nand Columbia students also share in a wide variety of social and\nextracurricular activities. Barnard boasts 80 undergraduate clubs, and\nstudents have access to an additional 500+ student life opportunities\nat Columbia.\nFrom its inception, Barnard has been committed to advancing the\nacademic, personal, and professional success of women. Students\nbeneﬁt from an atmosphere in which over half of the full-time faculty\nare women, and women are well represented in the administration.\nThe College is led by Laura Ann Rosenbury, former Dean at University\nof Florida Levin College of Law. At Barnard, women are given the\nopportunities and the freedom to lead both in and out of the classroom,\nand to develop the skills that will equip them to lead throughout their\nlives.\nBarnard’s unique ties to several of Columbia’s graduate schools and\nto premier New York City institutions, including the Juilliard School,\nthe Manhattan School of Music, the Jewish Theological Seminary of\nAmerica, and Teachers College, give students an unusual range of\neducational options, including a number of joint degree programs.  At\nBarnard students can earn a bachelors and masters through one of our\n4+1 programs within Columbia’s Fu Foundation School of Engineering\nand Applied Sciences, The School of International and Public Affairs,\nThe Mailman School of Public Health, The Harriman Institute and a\nquantitative masters at the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.\nAcademic organizations within and beyond the University also offer\nvital opportunities for research, study, studio experience, internships,\nand community service.\nBarnard has a high student retention rate, an indication of student\nsatisfaction with the college experience. Barnard students also enjoy\nleaves for study, travel, and internships. By senior year, about three-\nquarters of students have undertaken an internship and/or pursued\nfunded summer research across academic institutions, corporations,\nnonproﬁt organizations, government agencies, and in the arts. Every\nyear Barnard admits about 100 transfer students who come to take\nadvantage of the educational opportunities available to Barnard\nwomen.\nEvery year, Beyond Barnard collects and summarizes information about\npost-graduate study and employment. Within the ﬁrst six months after\ngraduation, 90% of Barnard graduates from Classes 2018-2020 were\nworking or enrolled in graduate or professional schools. Full reports are\navailable at Beyond Barnard's website.\nAccreditation\nBarnard College is accredited by the Commission on Higher Education\nof the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools, 3624 Market\nStreet, Philadelphia, PA 19104, 215-662-5606. The Commission on\nHigher Education is an institutional accrediting agency recognized by\nthe U.S. Secretary of Education and the Commission on Recognition of\nPostsecondary Accreditation.\nThe Barnard Education Program is accredited by the Association for\nAdvancing Quality in Educator Preparation (AAQEP) and approved by\nthe New York State Education Department to recommend students\nwho complete the program for Initial Certiﬁcation in either Childhood\nEducation (Grades 1-6) or Adolescent Education (Grades 7-12).\nFor more information, please visit https://education.barnard.edu/\ncertiﬁcation.\nThe Campus\nThe Barnard campus occupies four acres of urban property along\nthe west side of Broadway between 116th and 120th Streets. At the\nsouthern end of the campus, four residence buildings–Brooks Hall\n(1907), Hewitt Hall (1925), Helen Reid Hall (1961), and Iphigene Ochs\nSulzberger Hall (1988)–form an enclosed quadrangle known as the\n\"Quad.\"\nOpposite the Main Gate at 117th street is Barnard Hall (1917), which\ncontains seminar rooms, classrooms, faculty ofﬁces, and dance\nstudios. The Sulzberger Parlor on the third floor is used for meetings\nand special events. The Julius S. Held Lecture Hall is also on the third\nfloor. Barnard Hall’s ﬁrst and ground floors will be the location of the\nFrancine A. LeFrak Foundation Center for Well-Being when its physical\nspace opens in late 2024. The Center will serve as a centralized hub for\nall wellness-related initiatives across campus and will support a 360-\ndegree perspective on personal well-being that encompasses physical,\nﬁnancial, and mental health.\nJust north of Barnard Hall is the Cheryl and Philip Milstein Center for\nTeaching and Learning, opened in September 2018. Designed by the\naward-winning ﬁrm Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, the 128,000-square-\nfoot building—with a base of ﬁve floors and a tower of eleven floors —\nis a dynamic space at the heart of campus that is home to a new kind\nof library, connects students and faculty across disciplines, facilitates\ncollaboration, and fosters dialogue. The Milstein Center includes a\nnew kind of library, one that brings together current technologies and\nlearning spaces in an interactive setting.  As the academic hub of the\ncampus, the center links departments and disciplines both physically\nand philosophically. \nFurther to the north, Helen Goodhart Altschul Hall (1969) and the\nDiana Center (2010) face each other across an open plaza. The 14\nstories of Altschul Hall are devoted to the sciences. Herbert H. Lehman\nAuditorium is on the ﬁrst floor. Barnard has begun the process of\ntransforming Altschul Hall into the Roy and Diana Vagelos Science\nCenter (RDSC), a state-of-the-art research and teaching facility devoted\nto the experimental sciences.  The College will reimagine the building\nthrough a renovation of existing spaces, an expansion northward,\nand an interconnection into and onto Milbank Hall.  This restacking\nand expansion will create additional space for the Biology, Chemistry,\nEnvironmental Science, and Physics & Astronomy departments. The\nRDSC will also feature a community space to engage the broader\nMorningside Heights and Harlem communities with the sciences. \nThe Diana Center was designed by the renowned architecture ﬁrm\nWeiss/Manfredi and is the student center for the campus.  It contains\nthe Event Oval, the Louise Heublein McCagg ‘59 Gallery, the Glicker-\nMilstein Theatre, and the Barnard Store.  \nMilbank Hall (1897) occupies the furthest northern end of the campus\nand houses administrative and faculty ofﬁces, classrooms, the Arthur\nRoss Greenhouse, the Minor Latham Playhouse, and the Barnard\nToddler Center. \nIn 2003, the College’s four oldest buildings–Brooks Hall, Hewitt Hall,\nBarnard Hall, and Milbank Hall–were added to the National Register of\nHistoric Places.", "source": "pdfs/barnard 2024-2025.pdf"}
{"page_index": 6, "page_content": "6  Admissions\nIn the immediate neighborhood, Barnard maintains additional\nresidence halls, including Plimpton Hall, acquired in 1968; Eleanor\nThomas Elliott Hall, formerly 49 Claremont Avenue, acquired in 1982\nand renamed in 1992; Cathedral Gardens, constructed by Barnard in\n2006; and 537 West 121st Street, acquired in 2019. In addition, three\napartment buildings on West 116th Street, 600 (acquired in 1971), 616\n(acquired in 1964), and 620 (acquired in 1968) are Barnard residence\nhalls. The College also rents additional spaces at 601 West 110th\nStreet.  \nColumbia University is directly across the street on Broadway.\nAdmissions\nBarnard students change the world and how we view it. They are bold,\nthoughtful, analytical, intrepid and ambitious. They love to learn and\nmake connections from the classroom to the world around them. The\nadmissions team seeks candidates such as these to ﬁll our ﬁrst-year\nand transfer classes.     \nThe College admits students and administers its ﬁnancial aid and loan\nprograms, educational policies and programs, recreational programs,\nand other College programs and activities without regard to race, color,\ncreed, national origin, sexual orientation, or disability. We are need-blind\nfor ﬁrst-year U.S. citizens and permanent residents and need-aware for\ninternational students and transfer applicants. Barnard meets 100% of\ndemonstrated need and does not offer any merit-only scholarships.\nBarnard seeks students from diverse educational and cultural\nbackgrounds and from all geographic regions. However, no\npreconceived proﬁle of an ideal student population limits the number of\napplicants accepted from any one group. Admission is highly selective\nand our process is holistic and contextual; no one criterion or score\ndetermines acceptance. In addition to school records (all transcripts\nfrom 9th grade on), letters of recommendation, writing, and test scores\n(temporarily optional in 2024 and 2025), we carefully consider each\napplicant in terms of their personal qualities, intellectual potential,\nthe rigor of the curriculum they have pursued, and their potential for\nachievement at Barnard. We review each applicant in the context of her\nschool, community, and individual story.\nFirst-Year Application Procedures\nApplication Deadlines \nFirst-Year applicants can apply under an Early Decision or Regular\nDecision admission round. \nEarly Decision \nDeadline: November 1st\nNotiﬁcation: Mid-December\nThe Early Decision plan is intended for students who passionately\nbelieve that Barnard is their ﬁrst choice college. It is a binding decision\nplan, meaning that if you are admitted Early Decision, you commit to\nattend Barnard and must withdraw all other applications. Along with\nall other required and optional application materials, Early Decision\napplicants are required to submit an Early Decision Agreement which\nis signed by the applicant, their parent/guardian, and their counselor.\nStudents applying under the Early Decision plan must apply by\nNovember 1st. Decisions will be released by mid-December. \nNotiﬁcation of ﬁnancial aid assistance for those candidates who have\ndemonstrated ﬁnancial need will be provided at the same time as\nthe admissions decision. Once admitted, the student must submit a\nnonrefundable enrollment deposit by the enrollment deadline. This\ndeposit is applied toward tuition and fees for the ﬁrst year.\nIf a student is denied in the Early Decision round, this is the ﬁnal\ndecision for the year. Students are welcome to apply in subsequent\nyears as a transfer student.\nThe Admissions Committee may decide to defer a ﬁnal decision on\nan Early Decision application and move them to the Regular Decision\nRound. The student will then be reevaluated and receive a ﬁnal decision\nin late March. In that event, the student is asked to submit ﬁnal grades\nfrom the ﬁrst half of the senior year.\nRegular Decision \nDeadline: January 6th\nNotiﬁcation: Late March\nRegular Decision is an excellent choice for applicants who would like to\nconsider offers from various schools. The deadline for Regular Decision\nis January 6th. Students will be notiﬁed by late March. \nNotiﬁcation of ﬁnancial aid assistance for those candidates who have\ndemonstrated ﬁnancial need will be provided at the same time as the\nadmissions decision. Once admitted, the student must submit a non-\nrefundable enrollment deposit by the May 1st enrollment deadline. This\ndeposit is applied toward tuition and fees for the ﬁrst year.\nThe Barnard Application \nThe Barnard Application consists of two parts - the Application and\nthe Writing Supplement. Both can be submitted via the Common\nApplication. Barnard also participates in the Questbridge program. A\nnon-refundable fee of $75 must accompany the application. Students\nmay submit payment directly through the Common Application\nwebsite. Students with signiﬁcant ﬁnancial hardship can request a fee-\nwaiver through the applications.\nSecondary School Preparation\nEach candidate for admission should present a college preparatory\nprogram from an accredited secondary school or an equivalent\neducation representing a four-year course of study. Our most\ncompetitive applicants have taken four years of each of the ﬁve core\nsubject areas: English, math, science, foreign language, and social\nscience, during their high school years. They have also pursued\nadvanced, honors, or AP or IB where available. We do understand\nthat curriculums at schools vary; we are seeking students who have\nchallenged themselves academically and pursued a program that\nprovides them with good breadth. Students should discuss all their\noptions with their guidance counselor to ensure they are making\nrigorous choices within the context of their curriculum and course\nofferings. A secondary school diploma or equivalent is a requirement\nfor enrollment at the College.\nFirst-Year Entrance Tests\nFirst-Year Entrance Tests\nBarnard's admission process is holistic and contextual. Standardized\ntest scores are considered in conjunction with the rest of the\napplication and in context of the applicant's background. For this\nreason, test scores are only one component of our application review\nand they are never used as a sole criterion for selection. Barnard", "source": "pdfs/barnard 2024-2025.pdf"}
{"page_index": 7, "page_content": "Barnard College Catalogue 2024-2025 7\nrecognized the challenges that students were facing due to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic and, in response, Barnard has adopted an SAT\nand ACT test-optional admission policy for students applying through\nthe 2027 ﬁrst-year and transfer admissions cycles. This decision was\nmade in consultation with the President and the Board of Trustees\nand is not intended as an admissions policy shift, but rather as a\ntemporary measure driven by the current circumstances. Students\nmay apply without submitting standardized test scores from the SAT\nor ACT exam and no other materials will be requested in lieu of test\nscores. Applicants may still submit self-reported SAT or ACT scores\nfor consideration if they are able to do so. As in previous years, the\nCollege does not evaluate SAT Subject Tests. Please know that Barnard\nreviews all applications holistically. We consider each applicant in the\ncontext of her school, community, and individual story. Barnard seeks\nstudents who are intellectually motivated, community-minded, and\nexcited for academic exploration within the liberal arts.\nApplicants may still submit self-reported SAT or ACT scores for\nconsideration if they are able to do so.  If a student is admitted and\nplans to enroll, she must submit ofﬁcial scores.  It is the student’s\nresponsibility to direct the College Board or ACT Program to send\nofﬁcial test scores to the Ofﬁce of Admissions. The SAT tests code\nnumber for Barnard is 2038. The ACT code number for Barnard is 2718. \nStudents whose primary language is not English or who have not\nstudied for four or more years at a secondary school where the primary\nlanguage of instruction is English should submit scores from the Test\nof English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL), the International English\nLanguage Testing System (IELTS), or the Duolingo English Test.\nRecommendation Letters\nAnother important part of the ﬁrst-year application is the submission of\nthree recommendations, one from the high school counselor and two\nfrom academic teachers. We require two teacher recommendations\nin core subjects - english, math, science, social sciences, or foreign\nlanguage courses. While we recommend that these teachers be from\nyour last two years of high school, we will accept recommendation\nletters from 10th grade teachers. These recommendations give the\nAdmissions Committee additional information about the candidate’s\ninterests, character, skills, and contributions to the classroom. \nIn addition we require a letter of recommendation from your college\ncounselor. Due to large student caseloads, we understand if your\ncounselor is unable to send a recommendation for you. Please\ncontact us if this is the case. If your counselor is not able to submit\na recommendation, we would encourage you to send an additional\nteacher letter of recommendation.\nFor transfer students, we require a Dean or advisor recommendation\nand one college  academic recommendation.\nDeferring Enrollment (Gap Year)\nAdmitted students who wish to defer enrollment in Barnard for up to\none year must obtain permission by completing a deferral request\nform once admitted, explaining the reasons for the deferral request.\nSuch a request is normally granted for purposes of work, travel, or\npursuit of a special interest. Students are not allowed to matriculate\nat another institution during that year and should relinquish their\nspace on any wait lists for other institutions. Deferral requests must\nbe received by February 1 for students admitted Early Decision and\nApril 25 for students admitted Regular Decision. Transfer students\nand students admitted from the wait list are not permitted to defer\nadmission. Deferral requests do not factor into evaluations or\ncommittee decisions. Students can generally only defer for up to one\nyear.\nInternational Students\nWe broadly deﬁne international students to be 1) a citizen of a country\nother than the United States who has been educated abroad; 2) a\nU.S. citizen educated abroad; or 3) a Foreign National educated in the\nU.S.. International applicants follow the same application procedure\nand presenting the same credentials, or the regional equivalent, as\ndomestic candidates. Please submit materials as described under the\nApplication Requirements for First-Years or Transfers (no separate\nInternational Student application is required). In some cases, additional\ncredentials may be required, as described below.\nIn addition to any SAT/ACT requirements (see above), students whose\nprimary language is not English or who have not studied at a secondary\nschool for four or more years where the primary language of instruction\nis English should submit scores from the Test of English as a Foreign\nLanguage (TOEFL) , the International English Language Testing System\n(IELTS), or the Duolingo English Test.\nVISP: The Visiting International Students\nProgram\nThe Visiting International Students Program (VISP) brings students\nfrom across the globe to Barnard for one spring semester in residence\nat our campus in New York City. Through a limited number of\ncollaborative relationships with international universities, our partners\nsend cohorts of 3-15 undergraduate students to Barnard to spend\nthe spring semester as full-time visiting students. VISP students\nare fully integrated into the Barnard College academic and co-\ncurricular community, gaining a broad understanding of how liberal\narts institutions in the United States function, exploring the American\nmodel of undergraduate education, and studying and researching\nwith Barnard and Columbia University’s world-class faculty, while also\ncontributing to the internationalization of the student body.\nTransfer Students\nBarnard welcomes transfer students in the fall and spring term of each\nyear.

Credit for approved work at\nanother institution is applied to Barnard's 121-point graduation\nrequirement for transfers with a maximum of 60 external credits that\ncan be transferred toward a degree at Barnard College. The number\nof transfer credits accepted by Barnard is determined by the Ofﬁce of\nthe Registrar; students are notiﬁed of their credit status at the time\nof admission. Credit cannot be granted for courses with grades lower\nthan C-. Online classes taken in spring 2020 and subsequent semesters\nwill be considered for transfer credit if taken prior to a student's\nmatriculation at Barnard. Speciﬁc criteria for online courses to be\nconsidered for transfer credit can be found on the Registrar's webpage.\n  Students may not earn transfer credit for online classes taken at other\ncolleges or universities after matriculating at Barnard. Pre-evaluations\nof transfer credit are not conducted by the College. However, admitted\ntransfer students will receive a transfer credit evaluation indicating\ntransferable credits and satisﬁed Foundations requirements. Generally,\nif courses taken at another institution are in alignment with courses\noffered at Barnard, credit is likely to be awarded but not guaranteed.\nBarnard College reserves the right to accept or decline transfer of\ncredits based on its speciﬁc academic expectations.\nAfter acceptance, academic and general guidance is provided by the\nadvisers to transfer students in the Dean’s Ofﬁce for Advising and\nSupport.

Please use the left hand menu to navigate\nacademic policies. For additional information, visit the Registrar's\nwebsite.\nEnrollment\nPoints of Credit per Term\nBarnard students must complete 122 points of academic credit to\nearn the B.A. degree. (Those who enter Barnard as transfer students\nmust complete 121 points of academic credit.)  Students therefore\nneed to earn an average of 15 credits–which typically represents 4 to 5\nacademic courses (each of 3 or more credits)–per term. \nAll Barnard students are required to be enrolled full time.  Full-time\nenrollment status is deﬁned as a minimum of 12 credits per semester\nand a minimum of 24 credits over the course of the academic year.\n  Except in very speciﬁc circumstances as described in the Reduced\nCourseload section below, Barnard students are not permitted to enroll\npart time.\nIn a typical semester, students may take a maximum of 19 credits. \nIn certain cases, a student may register for up to 23 credits, subject\nto their advisor’s approval. Students with exceptional circumstances\nrequiring them to enroll in more than 23 credits in a semester must\nsubmit a petition to the Committee on Programs and Academic\nStanding.\nStudents who live on campus will be required to maintain a minimum\nof 12 credits unless approved for a Reduced Course Load per the\nReduced Course Load policy. \nStudents who do not complete a minimum of 12 credits for the fall\nor spring semester and 24 credits for the full academic year may be\nsubject to Academic Review action for insufﬁcient degree progress.\nEnrollment Conﬁrmation\nOfﬁcial enrollment conﬁrmation requires both a student’s successful\nregistration for at least 12 credits of coursework (unless otherwise\npermitted to enroll in fewer credits as per the Reduced Courseload\npolicy below) and remittance of Term Bill payment (net of ﬁnancial aid)\nby the semester registration/add deadline (end of the second week of\nclasses). Proper remittance will also include students who are up to\ndate on their Term Bill payment plan. Students who have not completed\nboth of these processes by the semester registration/add deadline\nwill be deregistered for courses and, therefore, considered not enrolled\nfor the semester. Students will then automatically be placed on a\npersonal leave of absence and should be aware of leave implications\nand procedures.\nReduced Course Load Policy\nGraduating seniors who need fewer than twelve credits to complete\ntheir degree – and who have already satisﬁed the College’s academic\nresidency requirement completed at least four full-time semesters\nin academic residence – may be approved to take a minimum of\nnine credit hours. Because Barnard students are charged a flat rate\nof tuition per semester, reducing one’s course load to nine credits\nwill not change the tuition owed in the last semester. International\nstudents must consult with International Student Services in advance\nto determine eligibility.  Students who meet these criteria and are\napproved to be enrolled in nine credits are still eligible to live in\nBarnard’s residence halls. \nIf any student who is not an eligible senior needs to register for\nfewer than twelve credits for disability-related reasons, they should\nreach out to CARDS to discuss the reduced course load process at\ncards@barnard.edu.\nCourse Registration\nAll students are required to register for classes online by the speciﬁed\ndeadlines for each semester as posted in the Academic Calendar. In\norder to receive credit and a ﬁnal grade for a class, a student must be\nofﬁcially registered for it; class attendance and/or appearance on a\ncourse’s waitlist are not considered ofﬁcial registration.  Students must\nobtain ﬁnal approval of their course schedules from their advisor by the\nclose of registration each semester.  \nColumbia University Courses\nMany courses offered in other divisions of the University are open\nto qualiﬁed Barnard students, including most Columbia University\nundergraduate courses with course numbers of 4000 and below.\nStudents can view any restrictions or special approvals required by\nlooking at the course listing in the Columbia Directory of Classes. \nBarnard students register for most fall or spring Columbia University\ncourses using Barnard’s registration system and they will appear on a\nstudent’s Barnard transcript. \nCourses offered through Columbia University’s graduate and\nprofessional schools may require additional approvals, and limitations\non the number of courses allowed may apply.  Students should\nreference the cross-registration information on the relevant Columbia\nschool’s webpage.  Barnard students are generally not eligible to enroll\nin courses offered by Columbia’s Medical School (including Nursing),\nLaw School, School of Social Work, or fall/spring courses offered by\nthe School of Professional Studies. Teachers College courses require\nspecial permission from the Barnard Dean for Academic Planning &\nClass Advising, as well as the payment of additional tuition.\nAdding Courses\nStudents may add courses online during the registration period, up to\nthe maximum number of allowed credits. Adding credits beyond the\nallowable limit requires the approval of the student's advisor. Courses\nmay not be added after the registration deadline for each term. Please\nrefer to the Academic Calendar for up-to-date registration deadlines. \nLate registrations require approval by the Committee on Programs and\nAcademic Standing and will be assessed additional fees.\nCourse Drops & Withdrawals\nCourses may be dropped online before the deadline published in the\nAcademic Calendar. The request must be approved by the student's\nadvisor. Courses dropped by the deadline will not be recorded on the\npermanent transcript.", "source": "pdfs/barnard 2024-2025.pdf"}

There are a relatively small number\nof courses with course-speciﬁc fees that may change if courses are\nadded or dropped. If a student changes their registration and the\ntuition called for is lower than the amount they have already paid, they\nwill be credited the excess only if the change in their registration is\nmade by the registration deadline (the second Friday of the full 14-week\nsemester). If the student’s new registration calls for higher tuition, the\nstudent is responsible for paying the additional charges promptly.\nSchedule of Classes and Room\nAssignments\nClass times and room numbers are published in the online Directory of\nClasses, which is updated every night.

The courses and grades will appear as\ninstitutional credit on Barnard student transcripts and will be included\nin the Barnard GPA. \nCredit for summer courses taken at other accredited institutions\n(including Columbia summer session) requires approval by a student’s\nadviser and/or department chair and the Registrar’s Ofﬁce.  If approved,\nthese courses will be treated as transfer credit; the courses will display\non the Barnard transcript but will not be counted towards the Barnard\nGPA calculation.  Barnard’s standard policies around transfer credit\napply, including the requirement that a student must earn a grade of C-\nor better in the course in order to transfer credit.  Additional regulations\nalso apply due to the uniqueness of summer sessions; for instance,\nthe College’s standard policy is that summer courses must meet\nfor at least 35 hours and at least 5 weeks to be eligible for Barnard\ncredit. In general, Barnard does not grant credit for online courses. A\nsupplemental fee is charged by Barnard to transfer summer credits\nfrom other institution(s), including Columbia.  Further regulations\naround summer credit can be found on the Registrar’s Ofﬁce webpage.\nConcurrent Enrollment\nStudents may not be enrolled in courses at Barnard and at another\nhigher education institution concurrently during the fall and spring\nterms. Exceptions are made for students accepted into Barnard’s\nexisting dual enrollment programs, including the Jewish Theological\nSeminary double degree programs, the 4+1 Pathways programs, as\nwell as students registering under Barnard’s existing cross-registration\nagreements (including the cross-registration agreement with programs\nwithin Columbia University). Barnard students may register at other\naccredited higher education institutions as visiting, non-degree-\nseeking students during the summer term, but must have the courses\napproved to ensure that the credits will transfer.  Students on a leave of\nabsence from Barnard may enroll at another institution for credit with\napproval from the Registrar’s Ofﬁce, with a maximum of nine credits\nper semester. (Students on required leave of absence may be required\nto transfer more credit and should reference the terms of their required\nleave.)\nOnline Courses\nStudents may not earn transfer credit for online classes taken at other\ncolleges or universities after matriculating at Barnard. This includes\ncredit taken in approved study abroad or exchange programs; credit\ntaken while on leave of absence from the College; and credit taken\nduring summer or winter sessions.\nPrior to Barnard credit for students\nentering as ﬁrst-year students\nFirst-year students with a record of prior coursework taken as non-\nmatriculants at an accredited, degree-granting college or universitymay\nrequest up to 15 points of transfer credit.  The courses must be\nintended primarily for college students and taught at the college by\nmembers of its faculty, and must be in excess of the courses required\nfor the high school diploma. Such work will be evaluated after the\nstudent has completed 12 points at Barnard.\nAttendance\nStudents are expected to attend classes regularly. Frequent or\nprolonged absences from classes may cause a student to forfeit the\nright to complete coursework or to take ﬁnal examinations. Students\nwho are experiencing academic challenges should be in touch with\ntheir class dean as soon as possible.\nPolicy on Religious Holidays\nIt is the policy of Barnard College to respect the religious beliefs of\ncommunity members. In compliance with New York State law, students\nwho are absent from school because of religious beliefs will be given\nan equivalent opportunity to register for classes or make up any\nexamination, study, or work requirements that they may have missed.\nNo student will be penalized for absence due to religious beliefs,\nand alternative means will be sought for satisfying the academic\nrequirements involved.

A student whose term or cumulative GPA falls below 2.0, or\nwho does not satisfactorily complete 12 or more credits in a term, or\nwho receives 3 or more incompletes or withdrawal grades in a given\nterm may be placed on academic probation. A student who does not\nsuccessfully complete a minimum of 12 credits in a term may be given\nan insufﬁcient degree progress warning. (Note: students who have not\nmade satisfactory academic progress, or SAP (see below), at the end of\nan academic year may be placed on Financial Aid Warning or Financial\nAid Probation in accordance with that ofﬁce’s processes.) Students\nwho have been approved for a reduced course load and earn a 2.0 GPA\nor higher in a term will remain in good standing.\nA student whose term or cumulative GPA falls below 2.0 for two\nconsecutive semesters, or who fails to complete 24 institutional credits\nat the end of every academic year at minimum, may be required to take\na leave of absence.\nConsequences of not being in Good Academic\nStanding\nAt the end of each semester, after student grades have been reviewed,\na student who is found\nnot to be in good academic standing may face the following\nconsequences:\na) Academic Probation\nb) Required Leave of Absence\nc) Insufﬁcient Degree Progress Warning\nFERPA and Parental/Legal Guardian Notiﬁcation\nBarnard will not notify parent(s) or legal guardian(s) of a change in a\nstudent’s academic standing status without written consent from the\nstudent, in compliance with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy\nAct (FERPA).

Individual\nstudents can elect Pass/Fail grading in other courses using the Pass/\nD/Fail option described below.\nAt the end of every semester, each student’s term GPA and cumulative\nGPA are calculated.  To remain in good academic standing, Barnard\nstudents must maintain both a term and cumulative GPA of 2.0.  The\nGPA may be used to determine eligibility for academic and co-curricular\nprograms as well as for awards.  A student cannot be recommended\nfor graduation with a cumulative average below 2.0.   \nFor GPA calculations, letter grades are converted to the following\nnumerical values:\nA+ = 4.3\nA = 4.0\nA- = 3.7\nB+ = 3.3\nB = 3.0\nB- = 2.7\nC+ = 2.3\nC = 2.0\nC- = 1.7\nD = 1.0\nF = 0\nGrades of P, P*, W, and UW are excluded from the GPA calculation.\nGrades of I and X are non-ﬁnal grades.  Once a ﬁnal grade is\ndetermined, it will factor into the GPA like any other grade.\nAt the end of each term all student records are examined. Generally,\nonly those students who have completed 12 points with cumulative\naverages of 2.0 or above are permitted to remain at Barnard. Students\nwhose work falls below the cumulative average of 2.0 may be permitted\nto continue at the college with probationary conditions at the discretion\nof the Committee on Programs and Academic Standing.\nCourses in which the student receives the grade of D may not be\ncounted toward the major requirement or the minor option.

The complete rules and instructions are\navailable on the Registrar's Ofﬁce website.  \nUnder the Pass/D/Fail option, a student is held responsible for fulﬁlling\nall course requirements. The instructor is not informed when a student\nelects the Pass/D/Fail option. The instructor will assign a letter grade,\nwhich will be converted to P/D/F on a student’s Barnard transcript as\nfollows:\nA letter grade of A+ through C- will appear on the transcript as a P, and\nwill not count in the grade point average (GPA)\nA letter grade of D will appear on the transcript as a D, and will count in\nthe GPA\nA letter grade of F will appear on the transcript as an F, and will count in\nthe GPA\nP/D/F Limitations\nBeginning fall 2023, Barnard's standard policy is that students can\nelect P/D/F grading in one course per term during the academic year\n(fall/spring).  This is in addition to any courses with mandatory pass/\nfail grading.\nStudents who do not utilize both P/D/F options during the academic\nyear may elect, in the summer immediately following, to take one\nBarnard Summer Session course on a P/D/F basis.  Barnard students\nmay not elect P/D/F in a Columbia Summer Session course because\nColumbia summer courses are considered transfer credit, and transfer\ncourses must have a standard letter grade in order to transfer.  \nUnder the standard policy, the P/D/F option cannot be elected for\nany course designated to count toward the major or the minor.  (As\nan exception, students were able to elect P/D/F grading for one fall\n2021 class to be used towards either a major or a minor requirement.) \nHowever, the P/D/F option may be elected for a course that is counting\ntowards a student’s general education requirements.\nExceptions to P/D/F policies for the 23-24 Academic year only:\n• For the fall 2023 semester only, Barnard students may elect a total\nof two courses Pass/D/Fail.  All other P/D/F policies apply.\n• For the spring 2024 semester only, Barnard students may elect\na total of two courses Pass/D/Fail.  Both of these Pass/D/Fail\ncourses may be courses in the student's major or minor; however,\nstudents may not elect any senior capstone courses as Pass/D/\nFail.\n• Although students were allowed an additional Pass/D/Fail election\nfor both fall 2023 and spring 2024, these exceptions do not afford\nan additional Pass/D/Fail election for the summer 2024 term.  \nPlease note that dean’s list eligibility requires a minimum of 12 letter-\ngraded points per semester.  A class in which a student elects P/D/\nF grading will not count towards that minimum.  Please see further\ndetails about Dean's List here.\nStudents should also make themselves aware of any ﬁnancial-aid\nrelated limitations to electing pass/fail grading by consulting the\nFinancial Aid Ofﬁce.\nStudents who may be facing extenuating circumstances in a particular\nsemester can petition to elect P/D/F grading in a second course, by\nspeaking with their class dean and then submitting a petition to the\nCollege’s Committee on Programs and Academic Standing (CPAS).\n  CPAS will not generally approve any petition that would result in a\nstudent having fewer than six credits of coursework that is either\nstandard letter-graded or mandatory pass/fail, unless a student has\nbeen previously approved for a reduced courseload (please refer to the\nreduced courseload policy for more information about this process). \nStudents who petition to elect P/D/F in an additional class should be\naware that this may disqualify them from consideration for dean’s list\nfor that semester.  Students with ongoing disability-related challenges\ncan also be in touch with CARDS to discuss reasonable academic\naccommodations.\nPrevious P/D/F policy (prior to fall 2023)\nPrior to fall 2023, students were limited to 23 credits of elected P/D/\nF coursework over the course of their Barnard career.  (For students\nwho entered as incoming transfers, the maximum was 22 credits.) \nAcademic Year 2020-21 classes in which students elected Pass/D/Fail\ngrading were excluded from the overall P/D/F credit maximum. As of\nfall 2023, Barnard students may not apply this previous P/D/F policy to\ntheir academic records for current or future terms.\nUncovering a P grade\nAfter ﬁnal grades become available for the semester, students may\nuncover their letter grade in a course in which they initially elected P/\nD/F grading.  The deadline to request the uncovering is the registration\ndeadline of the semester following the one in which the P/D/F course\nwas taken (e.g. the second Friday of the following semester), as noted\non the Academic Calendar.  A class in which the P grade is uncovered\nis still counted towards the one course per term P/D/F limit.\nPlease note that graduating seniors cannot uncover P/D/F grades in\ntheir ﬁnal semester.  However, if a graduating senior elected P/D/F in\na course that is required for the major or minor, the Registrar's Ofﬁce\nwill administratively uncover the grade at the point of graduation.  This\nmay affect a student’s ﬁnal cumulative or term GPA, as well as dean’s\nlist eligibility.\nIncompletes\nStudents with compelling circumstances who are unable to complete\na course due to outstanding coursework (other than the ﬁnal exam)\nmay request a grade of Incomplete from their instructor.  The student\nshould submit to the Registrar’s Ofﬁce an ofﬁcial Request for an\nIncomplete Grade form, approved by their instructor, by the last\nday of the Reading Period for the class. (In a course without a ﬁnal\nexamination, the deadline is the day before the ﬁnal paper is due if that\ndate precedes the last day of the Reading Period.)  \nThe remaining coursework must be submitted to the instructor by the\nIncomplete deadline, which is four months after the end of the term (for\nfall classes, the deadline is April 15; for spring classes, the deadline", "source": "pdfs/barnard 2024-2025.pdf"}

Transcripts can be sent by FedEx\nor Express Mail for an additional fee. Transcripts can be sent in paper\nor secure pdf format. Students and alumnae can request transcripts\nhere. Barnard cannot send copies of transcripts from other schools\nthat the student attended; they must be requested directly from the\nother institution.\nDean’s List\nEffective fall 2013: To be eligible for Dean's List, a student must be\nenrolled at Barnard on the Morningside Heights campus (or on a\nColumbia program abroad) and complete at least 12 letter-graded\npoints with a minimum grade point average of 3.60 for the term. (P-\ngraded points are excluded.) The grade point average will be based on\nall letter grades in the A to F range.\nBeginning with academic year 2020-2021, incoming ﬁrst-years are\nrequired to complete at least 9 letter-graded points with a minimum\ngrade point average of 3.60 for the term.  (P-graded points are\nexcluded.)\nSeniors who are approved to take less than 12 credits (by exception in\ntheir ﬁnal semester), must have 9 credits of letter-graded coursework to\nbe eligible for Dean's List.\nSpring 2020: Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the mandatory pass/\nfail grading policy, there was no dean's list for spring 2020.\nPrior to fall 2013: To be eligible for Dean's List, a student must be\nenrolled at Barnard for both terms and complete at least 12 letter-\ngraded points each term of an academic year with a minimum grade\npoint average of 3.4 for the academic year. (P-graded points are\nexcluded.) The grade point average will be based on all letter grades in\nthe A to F range.\nNote: Dean's list notations are not awarded for summer terms.\nCollege Honors\nThe Faculty awards honors to students who complete work for the\ndegree with distinction (cum laude), with high distinction (magna cum\nlaude), and with highest distinction (summa cum laude).  \nHonors are determined by a student’s ﬁnal cumulative Barnard GPA,\nwith the top 5 percent of the graduating class being awarded summa\ncum laude, the next 10 percent being awarded magna cum laude, and\nthe remaining 20 percent awarded cum laude.  \nThe minimum grade point averages that determine eligibility for each\ncategory of Latin Honors may change with each May’s graduating\nclass.  Those same criteria will be applied to the following February\nand October graduating classes.  (For example, the criteria for each\ncategory of honors for the May 2024 class will also be applied to the\nOctober 2024 and February 2025 graduating classes.)\nBeginning with the February and May 2022 graduating classes, study\nat other institutions (transfer, summer school, study leave) is not\nfactored into a student’s Latin honors eligibility.\nLatin honors appear on both the transcript and the diploma.\nDepartmental honors are awarded for distinguished work in the\nmajor to no more than 20% of graduates, as nominated by their\nmajor departments, and conferred by the Committee on Honors.\nDepartmental honors display on student transcripts but not diplomas.\nPhi Beta Kappa\nThe Barnard section of the Columbia University chapter of Phi Beta\nKappa was founded in 1901. Election to the national honor society is\na recognition of scholarship, and Barnard students of exceptionally\nhigh standing are eligible. Junior election will require a minimum of\n86 completed points, and senior election, 102. Students do not apply\nfor membership; they are elected by Barnard faculty members who are\nthemselves members of Phi Beta Kappa.\nEligibility for Student Government\nOfﬁces\nTo be a candidate for election to a student government ofﬁce, a student\nmust be in good academic standing and free of disciplinary action for\nat least one year.\nEligibility for Intercollegiate Athletics\nAny student at Barnard College, Columbia College, the Fu Foundation\nSchool of Engineering and Applied Science, or the School of General\nStudies who is pursuing the undergraduate program or a combined\nprogram toward a ﬁrst degree is eligible for intercollegiate athletics,\nprovided that certain conditions are met. To be eligible for athletic\nactivities, a student must:\n• be a candidate for a bachelor's degree;\n• be registered for at least 12 points of credit per semester;\n• be in satisfactory academic standing;\n• have passed by the beginning of the academic year 24 points if in\nthe second year, 52 points if in the third year, or 86 points if in the\nfourth year;\n• have attended the University for not more than eight terms;\n• not have completed the requirements for a bachelor’s degree.\nAn eligibility form must be ﬁled with the Department of Intercollegiate\nAthletics, which consults with the Registrar to determine eligibility.", "source": "pdfs/barnard 2024-2025.pdf"}

Although the responsibility for knowing the degree\nrequirements rests with each student, advisers offer support, guidance,\nand a sounding board, helping their advisees set goals and priorities,\nselect courses, and understand the curriculum. Class Deans in the\nCampus Life and Student Experience division also offer support,\nespecially if students encounter issues or have concerns that might\nextend beyond the classroom. \nClass Deans and Advisers\nPrior to matriculation, the First-Year Team communicates academic\nplanning and registration information to new students via email,\nvirtual meetings and also the First-Year Blog. First-year students are\nencouraged to subscribe to the First-Year Blog and may submit any\nquestions they have to ﬁrst-year@barnard.edu. Students enroll in their\nfall First-Year Experience courses over the summer. They also enroll\nin select Barnard classes deemed suitable for ﬁrst-year students. The\nformal ﬁnalization of course schedules happens in the fall, during\nOrientation and the ﬁrst two weeks of class. Assistance in planning\ncourses of study is given to ﬁrst-year students and sophomores by\ntheir academic advisers, with whom students are expected to schedule\nappointments for individual advising throughout the year. \nBy the second semester of sophomore year, each student chooses a\nmajor ﬁeld in consultation with the Sophomore Class Dean, an adviser,\nand the academic department. From then on, the major adviser guides\nadvanced study for the major. \nStudents are responsible for completing all degree requirements\nand completing 122 credits in order to graduate. Students who have\ncompleted the requisite number of credits and all of their Foundations\nand major requirements are expected to graduate. \nTransfer Students\nIncoming transfer students are assisted by the transfer advisers and\nthe Associate Dean for Transfer Students in planning their courses of\nstudy and selecting majors. Advising sessions are scheduled prior to\nthe students' arrival on campus and during Orientation, and individual\nappointments may be arranged throughout the academic year. Transfer\nstudents who enter with junior class standing are guided by both\ntransfer and major advisers during their ﬁrst Barnard semester.\nInternational Students\nThe Ofﬁce of International Student Services (ISS) supports all\ninternational students from the moment they have been accepted\nup through graduation and beyond. In addition to providing advising\nsupport, ISS provides programming for international students, as well\nas all information and support pertaining to visas, I-20s, and other\ntravel matters.\nStudy Abroad\nStudents who wish to study abroad for credit toward the Barnard\ndegree are urged to meet with Barnard Global advisers and discuss\ntheir plans with their pre/major adviser early on. To be eligible, students\nmust submit the Preliminary Barnard application by March 15th of the\nacademic year before they plan to go abroad. \nThe Preliminary Barnard application requires students to request\nan approval by their pre-major or major advisor. The student\nchooses their current advisor from a directory and the link to the\napproval questionnaire is sent to their advisor via email from\nstudyabroad@barnard.edu. The questionnaire is brief and does not\nrequire a letter of recommendation. Students may follow up with their\nadvisor to conﬁrm that the approval questionnaire has been completed\non their behalf. While the approval questionnaire can be submitted by\nthe advisor after the March 15th deadline, the student’s application will\nnot be reviewed by Barnard Global until it is complete.\nStudents may later request an academic letter of recommendation\nfrom a professor for the purpose of applying directly to their study\nabroad program, if one is required. \nFor pre-major/major advisers: if a student asks you to complete a form\nfor their program application which veriﬁes they are in good standing,\nplease check the instructions to conﬁrm that you–and not the study\nabroad adviser–should provide this information.  If you are not the\ncorrect recipient of the veriﬁcation form, please do not complete it;\ninstead, have the student either review the instructions for requesting\nan approval form or contact studyabroad@barnard.edu.\nHonor Code\nThe Honor Code, instituted at Barnard in 1912, governs all aspects\nof academic life and is enforced by an Honor Board that has a\nmembership of students and faculty members, advised by the Dean for\nAcademic Planning and Class Advising or designee. \nEach student who registers at Barnard agrees to maintain the Honor\nCode:\nApproved by the student body in 1912 and updated in 2016, the Code\nstates:\nWe, the students of Barnard College, resolve to uphold the honor\nof the College by engaging with integrity in all of our academic\npursuits. We afﬁrm that academic integrity is the honorable creation\nand presentation of our own work. We acknowledge that it is our\nresponsibility to seek clariﬁcation of proper forms of collaboration\nand use of academic resources in all assignments or exams. We\nconsider academic integrity to include the proper use and care for\nall print, electronic, or other academic resources.

As such, it\nis our hope that by addressing a multitude of interwoven topics, such\nas healthy relationships and sexuality, afﬁrmative consent, personal\nboundaries, self-care, bystander intervention, and social identities and\npower, that we may help reduce, and one day eliminate, sexual assault\nand violence from our campus and global communities.\nCenter for Accessibility Resources &\nDisability Services\nIn 1978, Barnard established a program to provide services for students\nwith disabilities, which enhances their educational, pre-professional,\nand personal development. The Center for Accessibility Resources &\nDisability Services (CARDS) serves students who have different types\nof disabilities such as mobility, visual, hearing loss, as well as students\nwith invisible disabilities, such as learning disabilities and ADD/ADHD,\nchronic medical conditions, psychological disabilities, and substance\nabuse recovery. CARDS works with other administrators and members\nof the faculty to assist students with disabilities in participating equally\nin college. Students who wish to seek accommodations at Barnard\nshould ﬁll out an  online application, submit supporting documentation,\nand schedule an intake meeting with their designated CARDS\ncoordinator. Accommodations are not granted retroactively, so it is\nbest to register with CARDS early on. Accommodation decisions are\nmade on a case-by-case basis, according to the type of disability a\nstudent has, information shared by the student during their meeting,\nand the recommendations of the student's documentation. The\nbuildings on the Barnard campus are wheelchair accessible. CARDS\nstaff can assist students with determining the best access routes on\ncampus. CARDS maintains a comprehensive webpage, which includes\nimportant information about accessing accommodations, how to\nregister, and policies related to accommodations.\nStudent Experience and Engagement\nThe mission of the Department of Student Experience and Engagement\n(SEE) is to create accessible, dynamic, thought-provoking co-curricular\nopportunities for Barnard students to explore purposeful involvement,\nself-discovery, and the development of meaningful relationships with\ntheir peers and the greater Barnard community. As an integral part\nof the student experience, SEE aims to connect students not only to\nresources available within the Department but all resources available\nat both Barnard and Columbia.

It serves as an open, accessible, and\ncreative space to connect with and create information in a way that is\nengaging, fosters collaboration, and sparks new thinking. The Milstein\nCenter is a home for scholarly exploration, innovation, and production,\nempowering the Barnard community collectively to challenge and\nexpand methods and scholarship, mix and remix content, and create\nnew conversations. It acts as a gateway to a creative frontier of\ninformation that can lead to brand new modes of teaching, learning,\nand discovery.\nBarnard Library & Academic Information\nServices (BLAIS) \nBarnard Library and Academic Information Services (BLAIS) supports\nexcellence and innovation in teaching and learning by providing\nexceptional research and instructional services, and by connecting the\nBarnard community to extensive information resources.

We\nhold more than 130,000 circulating books, zines, journals, and media\nin the Milstein Center. Another 23,000 volumes reside in a retrievable\nstorage facility; these are available for request in the CLIO Catalog\nand will be delivered to Barnard Library for pickup. The size of our\ncollection makes our library browseable, and we welcome you to visit\nthe shelves. \nWe have many specialized materials available for check-out. Founded\nin 2004, the internationally-renowned Barnard Zine Library is a\ncollection of zines with an emphasis on works by women, women\nof color, trans women of all races and ethnicities, as well as works\non feminism and femme identity by people of all genders. Zines\noffer researchers primary resource insights into feminist culture.\nThe circulating zines collection is located on the second floor of the\nMilstein Center, while an archival collection is held in the Barnard\nArchives. We hold a focused collection of books in Art and Architecture\n(which circulate) to complement Columbia’s Avery Library holdings\n(largely for library use only).  Our other special circulating collections\ninclude the Barnard Alum Collection; the Barnard BIPOC Alum\nCollection, which afﬁrms the lives, histories, and imaginations of past\nand current Barnard students who are Black, Indigenous, and/or People\nof Color; the Barnard FLI Partnership Library, a textbook library for\nﬁrst-generation and/or low-income students born of a partnership\nbetween the Barnard Library, the Columbia First-Generation Low-\nIncome Partnership, and Barnard SGA; Course Reserves; and the Media\nCollection. \nAs an afﬁliate of the Columbia University Libraries, the Barnard\nLibrary provides access to a world-class research collection while\nenriching it with its own unique holdings.

Incoming\nstudents are assigned to a personal librarian who will help them\nnavigate library resources, build on their research interests, and explore\nnew methods for research and scholarship. Personal librarians seek\nto understand student, faculty, and staff research needs, and provide\nindividualized consultation. As students select a major, the librarian\nafﬁliated with their ﬁeld becomes a guide for the research process\nin advanced courses, and ultimately the senior project, thesis, or\ncapstone. Librarians also provide instructional workshops in First Year\nWriting as well as foundational courses across the curriculum. They\nsupport both students and faculty in making connections from the\ncourse syllabus to the vast collections available at the Barnard Library,\nwithin the Columbia University Library system, across the New York\nmetropolitan area, and beyond. The Personal Librarians are partners for\nresearchers seeking to build projects that utilize the Milstein Centers,\nserving as a point of connection to other Milstein specialists. \nThe Barnard Archives and Special Collections collects and makes\naccessible materials that document campus and academic life at\nBarnard, as well as histories of feminism and dance.

BCRW’s founding\ntook place in the midst of feminist, Black freedom, anti- war, and Third\nWorld Liberation movements, international student mobilizations, and\nthe parallel creation of Black studies, ethnic studies, and women’s\nstudies programs at universities across the country. For more than ﬁfty\nyears, BCRW has built a bridge between students, scholars, activists,\nartists, neighbors, and our communities beyond New York through\npublic events, publications, multimedia projects, and working groups.\n BCRW is committed to vibrant and engaged research, pedagogy, art,\nand activism, supporting the work of scholars and activists to create\nnew knowledge and to challenge and reﬁne how we understand the\nworld around us. From our signature annual Scholar and Feminist\nConference to our peer-reviewed journal The Scholar and Feminist\nOnline, our unique collection of feminist social movement ephemera\nhoused in the Barnard College Archives and a constantly expanding\nvideo archive, and a rich history of collaborations with activists\nand artists, BCRW brings scholars and activists together to foment\nintersectional social justice feminist analyses and promote social\ntransformation.\nEvery semester, students, faculty, and community members can\nengage with BCRW through public programming and our open-access\npublications focusing on issues such as abolition and transformative\njustice; anticolonialism and Black transnational feminism; reproductive\njustice; labor and economic justice; and more. Students can get\ninvolved in the Center through a weekly social hour on Thursdays from\n12-1 p.m., the Center’s collaborations with student groups, and paid\nresearch assistantships.\nATHENA CENTER FOR LEADERSHIP\nThe Athena Center for Leadership is a hub for changemakers at\nBarnard College, itself a center for leadership for over 130 years. Our\nmission is to prepare Barnard students to lead change today and\nthroughout their lives. To this end, we work with a wide range of on-\nand off-campus partners to offer academic year and summer co-\ncurricular opportunities (in the form of 18+ communities of practice)\nfor Barnard students interested in applying what they learn in the\nclassroom to build the world we all deserve; summer programs\nfor future Barnard students to experience the Athena approach to\nleadership development, and two marquee programs for the public:\nSPARK, a series about change and how it happens, and the Athena\nFilm Festival, an annual showcase of original, thought-provoking,\ncompelling, and diverse women-centered stories of leadership.\nTHE TODDLER CENTER\nThe Center was created in 1973. In January 2023 we moved to our\nnewly renovated, state of the art classroom and research center on\nthe ground floor of Milbank Hall. Since the beginning, the Center has\nfunctioned as an integral part of the Psychology Department at Barnard\nCollege, providing an initial group social experience for toddlers, a\nunique learning experience for Barnard and Columbia College students,\nand a research site for developmental researchers. Barnard Psychology\ncourses use the center for students to observe toddler behavior and\nlearn about research methods. An upper level seminar provides a year\nlong opportunity for students to be part of the program while studying\ntheory and research in early development. Each year the Center enrolls\ntoddlers in one of four classes for the academic year (mid-September\nthrough June). All classes are structured by age and gender, and\ninclude children from diverse backgrounds.  Morning and afternoon\nclasses are available and meet once or twice a week. Parents and/\nor caregivers can participate in an educational group focused on the\ndevelopmental issues of the toddler years and on related parenting and\ncaregiving issues.\nThe approach of the Center is based upon the philosophy that\nchildren learn by doing: through experiences, exploration, and active\nparticipation with their environment.  Children’s discoveries promote\nmastery and feelings of competence. Emotional development is the\ncore to building security and trust at these ages. The Center provides\na warm environment to support each child’s needs, promote self\ndiscovery, and facilitate separation. \nRequirements for the Liberal Arts\nDegree\nBarnard's motto, Following the Way of Reason (Hepomene toi\nlogismoi), signals the College’s continuing commitment to the\nintellectual breadth and analytical depth of the liberal arts tradition.\nSince the College’s founding in 1889, a Barnard education has been\ncharacterized by its distinctive combination of elements: a rigorous,\nbroadly based framework of general education requirements; a focused\ninquiry into major subjects; and a range of electives. Together these\nelements allow for substantial personal choice. The exact structure of\nCollege requirements has varied over the past century in response to\nchanges in society, education, and student needs.

The College encourages students to\nproﬁt from the exceptional and varied opportunities to explore women’s\nhistories, challenges, and achievements. Gender-related matters\nare incorporated into a wide range of courses across the academic\ndisciplines.\nBarnard also encourages students to take full advantage of the global\ncity of New York—its international character and economic power; its\nprominence in science, medicine, and the arts; its cultural abundance;\nits diverse neighborhoods and peoples; and its architectural richness.\nIn their studies, their work, and their personal lives, Barnard students\ncan avail themselves of the city’s unparalleled resources. As an\nextended campus, New York serves not only as a multidisciplinary\nresearch laboratory for coursework and guided ﬁeld experiences, but\nalso as the site for a vast array of internships and wide-ranging, city-\nbased student activities.\nBarnard seeks to ensure that students become aware of, and\nknowledgeable about, their physical being. Students complete courses\nthat focus on physical activity, ﬁtness, and well-being. The College also\nprovides additional opportunities for students to exercise and to learn\nmore about fundamental elements of good health and women’s health\nissues. \nMajors and Electives\nDepartments and programs establish majors to provide a structured,\nfocused investigation of an academic discipline or interdisciplinary\nﬁeld of study.  Many of Barnard’s majors also require students to take\ncourses in cognate disciplines. Generally, there are three levels of study\nwithin each major: introductory survey courses; mid-level courses\nthat cover more specialized subject matter and where attention is\npaid to the methodologies, including the writing styles and formats,\nof the discipline; and advanced-level seminars with an emphasis on\nindependent research. The College has a long-standing commitment to\npreparing students sufﬁciently in a subject so that they may undertake\na semester- or year-long project, usually during the senior year, on a\ntopic related to their major.\nAll students complete the requirements of an approved major. Majors\nvary in the number of credits required. For students transferring credit\nfrom another college or university, a minimum of six semester courses\ntowards the major must be completed while the student is in residence\nat Barnard. Only courses graded C– or higher will be credited toward\nthe major.\nA student must ofﬁcially declare their chosen major(s) with the Ofﬁce\nof the Registrar and with the major department or program, normally in\nthe second term of their sophomore year. The major(s) may be chosen\nfrom any listed in the Barnard Catalogue.\nA student may major in two ﬁelds (“double major”) by satisfying\nall the major requirements prescribed by each department, with no\noverlapping courses. A student may also opt to double major with one\nintegrating senior project after consultation with the two departments.\n  Other than the senior project, the student must complete the standard\nrequirements for each major, with no overlapping courses.\nA “special” or “special combined” major is developed by a student when\nthey feel that their goals or interests cannot be satisﬁed within an\nestablished departmental major. “Special” majors comprise courses\nfrom throughout the College and University curricula and should\ninclude at least 12 courses. A faculty member will advise the student\nfor the special major. “Special combined” majors integrate in-depth\ncoursework in two established academic departments and should\ninclude at least 7 courses from each department. A faculty member\nfrom each department will advise the student throughout their study.", "source": "pdfs/barnard 2024-2025.pdf"}

During their ﬁrst semester in the\nprogram, students take a training course about the teaching of writing\n(ENGL BC3101 THE WRITER'S PROCESS), usually in the autumn term\nof their sophomore or junior year. Writing Fellows work in different\nsettings (e.g., the Writing Center, writing-intensive courses across\nthe curriculum) with Barnard undergraduates at all levels and in all\ndisciplines. Writing Fellows work an hourly wage and are asked to\nmake a commitment of three semesters to the Program.\nScience Writing Fellows \nScience Fellows are Writing Fellows focused on supporting students in\ncommunicating science at Barnard and beyond. Like Writing Fellows,\nScience Fellows enroll in the Writer’s Process then apply Writing Fellow\npedagogy to the more discipline-speciﬁc conventions of undergraduate\nscience writing. In addition to supporting courses and working in\nthe Writing Center, Science Fellows collaborate with campus groups\nincluding Beyond Barnard and the College Science and Technology\nEntry Program (CSTEP). The Science Fellows initiative was created\nwith the intent of providing a resource for science students that helps\nthem build critical thinking and communication skills.\nCreative Writing Fellows\nCreative Writing Fellows are a subset of the Writing Fellows Program\nfocused on supporting students taking creative writing classes,\napplying to take creative writing classes, or writing creative works\noutside of classes. Creative Writing Fellows apply writing pedagogy to\ncreative writing practices, exploring how readers interact with creative\nforms (poetry, ﬁction, creative nonﬁction, playwriting, and hybrid forms)\ndifferently than academic work. Through conversation and questioning,\nCreative Writing Fellows help students identify and articulate the\ndecisions they make in their writing and how those decisions affect\nfellows as readers.\nWriting-Intensive Courses Across the Disciplines\nStudents in these courses undertake at least three writing projects,\neach of which goes through at least two drafts. Writing Fellows read\nand confer with students on the ﬁrst drafts of their papers, which\nstudents revise, handing in both ﬁrst and second drafts to their\ninstructors, who comment on and grade the revised drafts.\nThe departments of Anthropology, Architecture, Art History, Asian\nand Middle Eastern Cultures, Biology, Dance, Economics, Education,\nEnglish, Environmental Science, French, History, Philosophy, Political\nScience, Psychology, Religion, Slavic, Sociology, Spanish, Theatre,\nand Women’s Studies have offered writing-intensive courses. Both\ninstructors and students report positive results. Students appreciate\nthe help they get in revising drafts and experience signiﬁcant gains in\ntheir writing skills. Instructors ﬁnd that the revised papers they receive\npermit them to focus their comments on course content, rather than on\nthe mechanics of writing.\nThe Writing Center\nIn addition to their work in speciﬁc courses across the curriculum,\nWriting Fellows staff the Erica Mann Jong '63 Writing Center (second\nfloor Barnard Hall). Any Barnard student is welcome to confer on a\nparticular writing project or to discuss some broader aspect of their\nwriting (e.g., articulating, organizing, and structuring ideas; analyzing\nevidence and connecting it to a claim; or reviewing concepts of\ngrammar). Students confer on chapters of their senior theses, drafts of\npapers for First-Year English, outlines or ideas for papers in upper-level\ncourses, lab reports, personal statements for admission to law school,\netc.\nThe Speaking Fellows Program\nStudents with exceptional public speaking skills and an interest in\nhelping their peers articulate their thoughts may apply for the Speaking\nFellows Program. Before becoming a Speaking Fellow, students\ntake a seminar and practicum in the theory and teaching of public\nspeaking (ENGL BC3123 Rhetorical Choices: the Theory and Practice\nof Public Speaking ), usually in the autumn term of their sophomore\nor junior year. As part of working with courses across the discipline,\nSpeaking Fellows help students with the fundamentals of public\nspeaking, presentation-giving, negotiating, and other skills required\nfor course assignments. They meet with Barnard students for bth\nindividualized and group workshops, and offer workshops on the art\nof listening, storytelling, helping with speech anxiety and more. The\nprogram approaches public speaking as a critical leadership ability\nand focuses on helping students know how to use rhetorical skills to\nhave an impact on the world around them. Speaking Fellows receive\na stipend and are asked to make a commitment of three semesters\nto the Program.Barnard Speaking Fellows are trained peer-to-peer\neducators who collaborate with students on building skills for speech\ncommunication. In addition to working with courses across the\ndiscipline, Speaking Fellows staff Barnard’s Speaking Center (second\nfloor Barnard Hall). Any Barnard student is welcome to confer about a\nclass presentation, job interview, or some broader aspect of speaking\nin public (e.g., how to articulate, organize, and structure thoughts for\na presentation; how to participate in class discussions; and how to\npractice active listening). Students meet with Speaking Fellows to\npractice presenting their senior thesis, build conﬁdence in leading or\nparticipating in seminar discussions, meeting with professors during\nofﬁce hours,  articulating scientiﬁc research etc.\nOpportunity Programs\nThe Opportunity Programs are the New York State-funded programs\nfor New York State residents who demonstrate ﬁnancial need and\nmeet certain academic standards. These include the Higher Education\nOpportunity Program (HEOP) and the College Science and Technology\nEntry Program (CSTEP). HEOP and CSTEP scholars receive additional\nsupport and advice to help them transition into College, addressing,\nthrough programming, counseling, ﬁnancial support, and other\nmeasures, the emotional, social, and academic challenges of being a\nlow-income student or underrepresented/marginalized student at an\nelite institution. ", "source": "pdfs/barnard 2024-2025.pdf"}

It engages as well the unﬁnished\nwork of achieving fully enfranchised forms of citizenship and the\nmany forms of expressive culture African diasporic communities have\ncreated and inspired as articulations of their histories, experiences, and\nstruggles. In so doing, Africana Studies trains students in the analytical\ntools necessary for rigorous and culturally sensitive analyses of racial\nformation both historically and in contemporary societies.\nMission\nAs a department for the multidisciplinary study of the history, politics,\ncultures, and literatures of Africa and African Diaspora communities in\nthe Americas, the Caribbean and Europe, Africana Studies at Barnard\nis deﬁned by a unique approach to studying the African Diaspora that\ncenters on a gendered analysis of racial and diasporic formations.\nIts central mission is to train students to think critically about the\ngendered nature of racial difference from a relational perspective: at\nonce locally, globally, and trans/nationally. The curriculum provides\nstudents with a deep knowledge of:\n• the history of African and African-descended cultures forged prior\nto and as a result of the Middle Passage;\n• the transnational communities of afﬁliation created in response to\ndiasporic dispersal; and\n• the diverse forms of cultural production engendered by Blacks in\nthe multiple contact zones that constitute the African diaspora.\nStudent Learning Outcomes\nStudents who complete the major in Africana Studies should be able to\nattain the following outcomes:\n1. integrate research tools and methods from a range of disciplines\nin order to study the history, politics, cultures, literatures, and\nexperiences of peoples in Africa and the African Diaspora;\n2. compare histories and cultures of black peoples across the globe;\n3. evaluate and interpret primary and secondary source materials;\n4. express themselves effectively in writing and oral presentations;\n5. demonstrate their understanding of Harlem's symbolic and\nhistorical importance to peoples of the African Diaspora;\n6. identify and communicate the importance of Africa and the African\nDiaspora to an increasingly global, diverse and interconnected\nworld;\n7. demonstrate in their coursework knowledge of the key intellectual\ntraditions of the African Diaspora;", "source": "pdfs/barnard 2024-2025.pdf"}

This seminar is focused\non understanding Fanon’s particular perspective on the psychology\nof the oppressed and its relevance for examining the experience\nof past and present racialized inequality and its effects in society.\nThe course is divided into four sections, which build cumulatively.\nI). An introductory section introduces Fanon’s central ideas (e.g.,\ndialecticism, existentialism, post-colonialism) in their intellectual\nand socio-historical context (e.g., the Algerian revolution, African\ndecolonization, South African Apartheid, the US civil rights and\nwomen’s rights movements).

The cultural\nand political (Eurocentric?) roots of psychological theory and practice\nare examined as are notions of oppression causing psychological\nand physical violence as well as psychopathology / psychological\ndisorder. III). A third section examines Fanon and others psychological\napproaches to identity with particular attention to the presumed\n“inferiority complex” of oppressed peoples, nationalist and other\nreconstructions of identity in opposition to oppression, sociological\npsychological conceptualizations of stigma, and Dubois’s influential\nideas regarding double consciousness.

This hands-on, project based course introduces students\nto the use of digital tools and sources to organize and manage their\narchival research, creatively interpret their ﬁndings, and communicate\ntheir results to the public. This semester, the course is somewhat\ndifferent from the usual research course in that, rather than simply\ngoing more deeply into the course focus, you will be asked to apply\nyour knowledge to make new things. Working with the Barnard Digital\nHumanities Center, you will develop projects that teach some aspect\nof Shange's work and or feminist movements. But while making\nthese new things, we will have ongoing discussions about the nature\nof digital life and evolving protocols for digital work. You will make\nplans to visit the archive appropriate to your project (in most cases\nthis will be the Barnard Archives, but they might include sites such\nas The Billy Rose Theatre Division at the NYPL, or the Amiri Baraka\ncollection at Columbia University) as well as doing background reading\nfor your project.  By the end of the semester, you'll have sharpened\nyour research skills while also acquiring digital, teamwork, and project\nmanagement skills that will be useful in other classes and beyond.", "source": "pdfs/barnard 2024-2025.pdf"}

Interpreted differently by different thinkers, imitation\ncan refer to the problem of art’s imitation of things in the world (e.g.,\nyour portrait looks like you), art’s imitation of other artistic works\n(e.g., your portrait looks like a Rembrandt), people’s imitation or\neven mimicry of one another (who does she think she is?). The latter\nform of imitation raises the most overtly socio-political questions,\nwhether by replicating social power structures in order to “pass”\nin a potentially hostile environment or by subverting these same\nstructures through mimicking, outwitting, critiquing, or mocking\nthem. At its core, the category of imitation focuses our attention on\nwhat is so central to artmaking that it almost eludes our notice: the\nquestion of resemblance.

In considering the United States as a cultural, ideological,\ngeographical and historical formation, students of American Studies\nexamine how cultural conﬁgurations of and within the nation-state\noperate as social forces, contested archives of change, loci of power\nand resistance, and sites of historical meaning and memory. How are\nideologies and arrangements in the U.S. ampliﬁed, altered, challenged\nor contested? American Studies seeks to address these questions by\ncritically examining how ideas and assumptions about the U.S. have\nbeen constituted through a range of competing, corroborating and\nresistant discourses.\nBarnard students majoring in American Studies engage in the\ncritical and interdisciplinary study of race, gender, class, sexuality,\nIndigeneity, political economy, imperialism and social movements in\ncontemporary, historical, hemispheric and transnational contexts.\nAll majors are introduced to the ﬁeld through AMST 1001 (“What Is\nAmerican Studies?”) and hone their understanding of the theories\nand methods of American Studies in an intensive junior colloquium.\nTheir individually-chosen electives include three historically-situated\nFoundations courses as well as a ﬁve-course concentration that\nculminates in a two-course senior capstone project. The American\nStudies major aims to teach students to recognize, question and\nanalyze, within an international context, the formation, implementation\nand contestation of power in both the nation-state and in other\ninstitutions of collective life.\nWe work closely with our colleagues in Africana Studies and Women's,\nGender, and Sexuality Studies who, along with the faculty in American\nStudies, constitute Barnard's Consortium for Critical Interdisciplinary\nStudies.\nMission\nThe American Studies major is designed to teach students how to\nengage in the critical and inter-disciplinary study of race, gender,\nclass, sexuality, Indigeneity, political economy, imperialism and social\nmovements in contemporary, historical, hemispheric and transnational\ncontexts.\nStudent Learning Objectives\nBarnard students graduating with a degree in American Studies aspire\nto do the following:\n• critically analyze power at different scales, from the local to the\nglobal.\n• identify the plurality of forces that shape and contest American\nsocial formations.\n• demonstrate an understanding of the various theories and\nmethods (e.g., oral history, ethnography, cultural analysis, archival\nresearch, political economy, and close textual, visual, or aural\nanalysis) that shape core conversations in the ﬁeld.\n• produce an original piece of scholarship with a sustained argument\nthat draws on primary sources and is accountable to communities\nof scholars in American Studies.\n• apply cultural and historical analytical frameworks to their lived\nexperience and practice.\nThe American Studies Major\nStudents build their major by combining coursework in the American\nStudies department with a wide range of potential electives drawn from\nAfricana Studies, Anthropology, Art History, English, History, Political\nScience, Women's Gender and Sexuality Studies, and other related\ndisciplines. In the process, students work with their American Studies\nadviser to devise a distinctive concentration organized around a topic\n(for example, race and ethnicity) that will encourage the development\nof both interdisciplinary breadth and historical depth while also serving\nas the intellectual foundation for their senior capstone projects.\nAmerican Studies majors may also choose to pursue one of the\nfour CCIS interdisciplinary concentrations on Race and Ethnicity\n(ICORE), the Environmental Humanities (EHMC), Native American and\nIndigenous Studies (NAIS), and Feminist/Intersectional Science and\nTechnology Studies (F/ISTS).\nStudents interested in majoring in American Studies are encouraged\nto contact Prof. Manu Karuka (mkaruka@barnard.edu), the\ndepartment chair, to arrange a meeting.\nThis department is supervised by the Committee on American Studies:", "source": "pdfs/barnard 2024-2025.pdf"}

Towards\nthis end, they are required to take at least two courses focused on the pre-Cold War\nhistory of the Americas (effectively, pre-1950). The courses may be selected from an\never-growing list from History, English, Africana Studies, Anthropology, Art History, and\nrelated departments.\n3.

We will explore the cultural history and aesthetic debates\nthat animated Harlem in the 1920s by reading them through the work\n(poetry, ﬁction, essays, plays) of Barnard and Columbia’s own, who,\nfor a time juggled student life in Morningside Heights and the joys\nand challenges of being major players in the Harlem or New Negro\nRenaissance. Hurston and Hughes navigated the demands of being\nan artist and representative of \"the race\" in both similar and different\nways. They worked together to shape the Renaissance according\nto their radical visions and were friends and collaborators until they\nfamously fell out. The goal of this class is to plot the individual and\ncollective artistic growth and experimentation of Hurston and Hughes,\nas well as create a digital timeline and rendering of their individual\nand collaborative development. To that end, this class will use either\nor both of the digital tools Scalar and Timeline.js in creative and\ncollaborative ways.

How many times has rock “died”? What\nis rock music’s relevance both historically and today? This course will\nintroduce you to popular music studies, a ﬁeld of inquiry that draws\nscholars from a number of different disciplines, including musicology,\nsociology, philosophy, anthropology and literature. Examining rock\nmusic in an interdisciplinary way has opened the genre to increasing\nattention beyond musicological methodologies and assumptions. First,\nhowever, we must ask some fundamental questions: for instance, what,\nexactly, is popular music as well as, importantly, what differentiates\nrock music from other genres? Our deﬁnitions will reveal some of the\nassumptions we bring to any discussion of popular music. Throughout\nthis semester, we will question our assumptions about rock music\nculture through an investigation into a series of keywords. Each\nkeyword will focus our attention on various aspects of rock music in\norder to think through the complexities of what might, on the surface,\nseem self-evident.

Historically,\nanthropologists studied non-European societies, describing their social\nand linguistic systems, their patterns of thought and culture and by\ndoing so they aimed to throw into relief the contingency of normative\nWestern assumptions.\nContemporary anthropology examines a very different landscape.\n  It seeks to examine not just the diversity of cultural practices\nbut to understand how societies clash, mutually interact and are\ninterconnected through movements of goods, people, ideas, culture\nand politics.  Anthropology today is thus more genuinely cross-cultural\nthan it once was.  Anthropologists conduct research with urban New\nYorkers as often as with Mayan peasants, with genetic scientists as\nmuch as with spirit adepts and seek to understand the increasingly\ncomplex interconnections of people around the world.\nThe Department of Anthropology\nOur faculty specialize in science and medicine, technology and\nmedia, religion, language and cognition, visual and material\nculture, colonialism and postcolonialism, and conservation and the\nenvironment.  We conduct research in Africa, the U.S., Oceania, the\nMiddle East and Latin America and in doing so we use a variety of foci,\ntacking between the immediacy of local modes of lived experience and\nbroader social and political transformations.\nMission\nAnthropology seeks to prepare students to succeed in a globalized\nworld.  It provides them with the skills to identify problems in\nintercultural settings, to recognize alternative lived realities, to discuss\nsolutions with colleagues of diverse backgrounds, and to communicate\nthose solutions to broader publics.\nStudent Learning Outcomes\nUpon successfully completing the major, students should be able to\nattain the following outcomes:\n• Articulate key methodological and theoretical debates in the\nhistory of the discipline;\n• Compare and use distinct analytical frameworks for interpreting\nmeaningful social behavior, detecting patterns and thinking\ncomparatively across social domains, cultures and contexts;\n• Develop an anthropological sensibility that enables one to distill\nsocial meaning from everyday encounters with individuals, material\nobjects, texts and other social phenomena;\n• Undertake ethnographic, linguistic or archaeological ﬁeldwork\nusing the appropriate methods;\n• Conceptualize, undertake, and present an original research project\nby the end of the senior year.\nThe department also cooperates with related programs such as\nAfricana Studies, American Studies, Human Rights, Urban Studies,\nand Women’s Studies. Arrangements for combined, double, joint, and\nspecial majors are made in consultation with the chair.", "source": "pdfs/barnard 2024-2025.pdf"}

Priority given to majors in Anthropology.\nThis course focuses on the political ecology of the Anthropocene.\nAs multiple publics become increasingly aware of the extensive and\naccelerated rate of current global environmental change, and the\npresence of anthropogenesis in ever expanding circumstances, we\nneed to critically analyze the categories of thought and action being\ndeveloped in order to carefully approach this change. Our concern is\nthus not so much the Anthropocene as an immutable fact, inevitable\nevent, or deﬁnitive period of time (signiﬁcant though these are), but\nrather for the political, social, and intellectual consequences of this\nimportant idea. Thus we seek to understand the creativity of \"The\nAnthropocene\" as a political, rhetorical, and social category. We also\naim to examine the networks of capital and power that have given rise\nto the current state of planetary change, the strategies for ameliorating\nthose changes, and how these are simultaneously implicated in the\nrhetorical creation of \"The Anthropocene\".\nSpring 2025: ANTH UN3861\nCourse\nNumber\nSection/Call\nNumber\nTimes/Location Instructor Points Enrollment\nANTH 3861 001/00647 M 6:10pm - 8:00pm \n113 Milstein Center\nPatrick Nason 4 6/15\nANTH V3660 Gender, Culture, and Human Rights. 3 points.\nBC: Fulﬁllment of General Education Requirement: Cultures in\nComparison (CUL). \nNot offered during 2023-2024 academic year.\nANTH BC3868 ETHNOGRAPHIC FIELD RESEARCH IN NYC. 4.00 points.\nThis course provides the aspiring anthropologist with an array of\nprimarily qualitative methodological tools essential to successful\nurban ﬁeldwork.

A liberal arts education in\narchitecture holds a unique position in academia and in relation to the\ndiscipline. If the goal of a professional education in architecture is to\nenable students to participate directly in the world as an architect –\na liberal arts education asks that students consider the broader and\nmyriad conditions in which architecture is conceived and practiced\nand, in turn, to understand how architecture inevitably alters those\nconditions. Students are asked to confront and interpret the complex\nsocial, cultural, political, and environmental processes that weave\nthrough architectural design and urbanism. The purpose of an\nundergraduate liberal arts degree in architecture is to educate students\nto think about the world through architecture.\nThe Architecture curriculum introduces design at a variety of scales,\nacknowledging that integrated design thinking is effective for problem-\nsolving at any scale and in any discipline. Students will experiment\nwith full-scale installations and devices and make small-scale models\nof the built environment from which they extract, interpret, and invent\nnew possibilities of inhabitation and use. The curriculum intentionally\nbalances the traditions of handcrafted representation with evolving\ndigital technologies of architectural design and communication.\nThe Architecture major complements, and makes great use of its\nUniversity setting. With access to superb libraries, research centers,\ngraduate programs, and abundant intellectual resources, our students\nhave the opportunity to follow their creative instincts to great depth\nand breadth – and they do. The major takes full advantage of New\nYork City, utilizing it as a site for many design and research projects\nthat explore the social, cultural, and environmental histories that have\nshaped the city. Architecture students study with peers from countries\naround the world in one of the most diverse cities in the world. A large\nmajority of Architecture students expand their education by interning\nin Architecture or a related ﬁeld during their undergraduate studies.\nAlumni of the Department are leaders in architecture and design ﬁelds\naround the world. The faculty teaching in the undergraduate program\nare dedicated teachers who are also at the forefront of practice and\nresearch and are similarly drawn to New York City as a nexus of global\ndesign thinking.\nStudents interested in obtaining a professional degree in Architecture\ncontinue on to graduate programs after their undergraduate degree,\nand students from the Barnard Columbia program have enjoyed\nenormous success in their admissions to the most competitive\ngraduate programs in the country. Students who study Architecture\nas undergraduates have also pursued graduate degrees in a variety\nof disciplines including Urban Planning, Law, and Media and\nCommunications.\nMission\nThe Architecture major establishes an intellectual context for students\nto interpret the relation of form, space, program, materials, and media\nto human life and thought. Through the Architecture curriculum,\nstudents participate in the ongoing shaping of knowledge about the\nbuilt environment and learn to see architecture as one among many\nforms of cultural production. At the same time, the major stresses\nthe necessity of learning disciplinary-speciﬁc tools, methods, terms\nand critiques. Thus, work in the studio, lecture or seminar asks that\nstudents treat architecture as a form of research and speculation\nwhich complement the liberal arts mission of expansive thinking.\nStudent Learning Outcomes\nStudents in the Architecture Majors who fully engage with the\ncurriculum should be able to complete the following outcomes:\n• Apply integrated design thinking to speciﬁc problems in and\nbeyond the discipline.\n• Visually communicate architectural concepts and research using\ndiscipline-speciﬁc techniques in multiple media.\n• Verbally present independent, group or assigned research, in\nmultiple media formats.\n• Organize and concisely write in a variety of formats including\nreports, case studies, synthetic overviews, etc.\n• Understand and critically interpret major buildings and themes of\nArchitectural history and theory.\n• Be intellectually prepared for graduate studies in architecture and\nrelated disciplines.\nPrograms of Study\nThere are a few distinctions between the opportunities for students\nat Barnard College, Columbia College, The Fu Foundation School of\nEngineering and Applied Science (SEAS), and the School of General\nStudies to study architecture at an undergraduate level.\nBarnard College students can major in Architecture (p. 86) (also\nreferred to as the studio major), major in the History and Theory of", "source": "pdfs/barnard 2024-2025.pdf"}

Although minors are not formally assigned to a faculty\nadvisor, we welcome and encourage our minors to meet with our\nfaculty advisors to address any questions.\nMajor and Minor Requirements Worksheets \nMajor and minor worksheets are intended to help students plan their\ncoursework and the completion of their program of study. You can\ndownload major and minor worksheets here.\nThe Architecture Department Newsletter  \nOur department distributes a biweekly newsletter for architecture\nstudents. Students who are enrolled in one of our courses or who have\ndeclared the major in architecture are automatically subscribed to this\nnewsletter. Those who are not in our courses and wish to subscribe to\nour newsletter can do so here.\nArchitecture Program Planning Meetings \nOur department hosts two program planning meetings per year, one\nin October and another in April. At these meetings, students can learn\nabout our course offerings, the course application process, and the\nmajor and minor requirements. Information about upcoming program\nplanning meetings can be found on our website’s events calendar.\nGuidance for First-Year Students\nFor ﬁrst-year students who are interested in architecture and design,\nwe offer the following course, which prioritizes ﬁrst-year students:\nARCH UN1010 Design Futures: New York City\nIn addition to taking Design Futures: NYC, ﬁrst-year students are\nencouraged to refer to our program planning lists and review any\nlecture courses that can count towards the architecture major and\nminor requirements. First-year students are discouraged from applying\nfor admission to our introductory-level studios Architectural Design:\nSystems and Materials or Architectural Design: Environments and\nMediations; these courses are more appropriate for second and third-\nyear students, and those students will be given priority for admission to\nthese studios. Similarly, our required lecture course for the major, ARCH\nUN3117 Modern Architecture in the World, can be taken at any time\nbut is generally recommended for the sophomore year as a companion\ncourse to the ﬁrst two studios.\nPlease note that ﬁrst-year students interested in majoring in\narchitecture should not enroll in ARCH UN1020 Introduction to\nArchitectural Design & Visual Culture, as this course is intended for\nthird and fourth-year students minoring in architecture or non-majors\ninterested in an architecture studio. This course will not count toward\nthe architecture major.\nTo learn more about our courses and department, ﬁrst-year\nstudents are strongly encouraged to sign up for our faculty advising\nappointments. \nEnrolling in Courses\nCourse Applications\nMany architecture courses require an application. To receive full\nconsideration for admission, you must ﬁll out the course application\nin advance and also join the online course waitlist during an early\nregistration period.\nPlease note that our department will only review applications and\nprocess admissions during speciﬁc weeks, with priority given to those\nwho apply and join the waitlists during one of the early registration\nperiods. \nAdmission to our courses is at the discretion of the department and\ninstructor. If a student is admitted from the waitlist, their status on\nSSOL will change to \"Approved.\" The transition from the waitlist to the\nclass list will occur automatically overnight.\nDue to very limited space in our courses, it is possible that a student\nwho has applied and joined the waitlist during an early registration\nwindow will remain on the waitlist until the start of classes. Once\nthe semester begins, students who remain on the waitlist for any of\nour courses must attend the ﬁrst class session and speak with the\ninstructor to inquire about available spots.\nTo learn more about our course application process, please visit our\nwebsite.\nPreparation for Graduate Study\nStudents who wish to pursue graduate study in architecture or related\nﬁelds are strongly encouraged to sign up for our faculty advising\nappointments in their junior or senior year.\nCoursework Taken Outside of Barnard\n(For Barnard Students Only)\nOur department offers studio, lecture, seminar, and project-based\ncourses that can be counted toward a major or minor in architecture.\nCourses taught by our department are often supplemented by courses", "source": "pdfs/barnard 2024-2025.pdf"}

The course interrogates our changing\nattitudes to nature from the 18th century to the present, focusing on\nthe artistic and architectural responses to these perceptions. It aims\nto demonstrate the important role that artists and architects have\nplayed, and are to play, in making visible the sources of environmental\ndegradation and in the development of new means of mitigating\nanthropogenic ecological change. City, Landscape, Ecology is divided\ninto three parts. Part I explores important episodes in the history of\nlandscape: picturesque garden theory, notions of “wilderness” as\nepitomized in national and state parks in the United States, Modern\nand Postmodern garden practices, and the prevalence of landscape\nin the work of artists from the 1960s to the present. The purpose\nhere is to better understand the role that territorial organization plays\nin the construction of social practices, human subjectivities, and\ntechnologies of power. We then turn to ecology and related issues of\nclimate, urbanization and sustainability in Part II. Here we will look\nat the rise of ecological thinking in the 1960s; approaches to the\nenvironment that were based on the systems-thinking approach of\nthe era. In the session “Capitalism, Race and Population Growth” we\nexamine the history of the “crisis” of scarcity from Thomas Robert\nMalthus, to Paul R. Ehrlich (The Population Bomb, 1968) to today and\nlook at questions of environmental racism, violence and equity. The\ncourse concludes with Part III (Hybrid Natures). At this important\njuncture in the course, we will ask what is to be done today.

Modern Architecture in\nthe World is an introduction to different arenas in which architecture’s\nmodern condition has been disputed in the last two centuries\nacross different geographies. The course will address signiﬁcant\ntransformations in the built environment as well as the forms of\npractice, epistemic frameworks, and ideologies that led them. It will\nalso attend to the forms of labor and economies that engendered new\nstructures and organizations of space, the material resources and\nindustries mobilized in their construction, the identities and forms\nof power they represented and imposed, the manifold embodiments\nthat they hosted and shaped, the diverse socialites and politics\nthey supported, and the ecologies they negotiated. The course is\norganized around a number of key themes, with each class covering\nepisodes spanning the whole period under consideration, up until\nthe present. In this way, it will question the existence of a single line\nof development, a master narrative, or a teleological line of progress\nand will highlight instead the multiple, simultaneous, conflicting, and\nbranching genealogies unfolding throughout the period. Students will\ngain knowledge of key buildings, artifacts, trends, and schools as they\nrelate to those genealogies. Each lecture will emphasize contending\nand shifting positions across geographies within the arenas explored,\nunderstanding hegemonic trends as well as dissenting positions. While\ndifferent locations around the world will be highlighted in each class,\nthe course positions modern architecture in the world by privileging\nan exploration of the cultural and material networks and hierarchies\ncharacteristic of the period—with attention to colonialism, coloniality,\nmigration, resource extraction, and war, among others\nSpring 2025: ARCH UN3117\nCourse\nNumber\nSection/Call\nNumber\nTimes/Location Instructor Points Enrollment\nARCH 3117 001/00825 T Th 4:10pm - 5:25pm \n504 Diana Center\nIgnacio\nGonzalez\nGalan\n4.00 63/60\nARCH UN3202 ADVANCED ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN II. 4.50 points.\nPrerequisites: ARCH V3201.

The intent is to offer an alternative to those with less interest\nin a major writing project.\nWRITTEN SENIOR THESIS OPTIONS\n1. Students interested in participating in the year-long Senior Thesis\nSeminar should write a brief (one-page) description of their thesis\ntopic and submit it to the appropriate adviser within the ﬁrst two\nweeks of the fall semester. The potential adviser will determine\nthe feasibility of the study in question and accept or decline to\nbecome the student’s adviser. Such a thesis should ultimately be\napproximately 30-50 pages long.\n2. Students interested in expanding and enhancing a seminar paper\nwill ﬁnd a faculty adviser, preferably the professor with whom they\nwrote the original paper, willing to help them in its transformation\ninto a thesis. They will then join the Senior Thesis in the spring\nsemester of their senior year. In this context they will have an\nopportunity to present their ideas to the rest of the graduating\nclass as well as members of the faculty so as to receive comments\nand suggestions as to how to develop their arguments. These\ncreated by these means should aim to be approximately 30 pages\nlong.\nGRADES \nTwo grades will be awarded in connection with your work on the\nﬁnished thesis. One will evaluate the way in which you have fulﬁlled\nthe requirements of the Senior Research Seminar. That is, your\nparticipation and attendance in the Thesis Colloquium, the energy you\nhave put into the research, the effort you have made in producing an\noriginal and challenging argument as well as a solidly constructed and\npolished piece of prose. Since the course is yearlong, students will\nreceive a grade of Y (indicating year long course) for the fall semester\nand will receive their grade at the end of the spring term for the year.\nThis grade will be assigned in the usual A through F spectrum. The\nother grade will be awarded on the basis of the evaluation of the\nthesis itself. This evaluation will consider whether or not the aims\nof the project were met: was the research sufﬁcient to warrant the\nconclusions, is the argument of the thesis original as well as coherent\nand convincing, was the writing adequate to the ideas that had to be\nexpressed? Very often the instructor will ask another member of the\nfaculty to comment on the paper as well. This grade will either be a\nPass with Distinction, a Pass or a Fail.\nNOTE ON SENIOR THESIS FOR DOUBLE AND COMBINED MAJORS \nPlease note the distinctions between the Double Major, the Double\nMajor with a Single Essay, and the Combined Major. In the Double\nMajor students will do all of the required course work for both majors\nand write two different Senior Essays that fulﬁll the requirements of\neach department. In the Double Major with Single Essay students do all\nof the required course work for the two majors and write only one essay\nread by an adviser in each major ﬁeld.

This class explores why monuments are important,\nhow they have been used historically to assert political and social\npower and different points of view on where to go from here. The\nnation is caught up in a vital debate about how historical ﬁgures and\nevents should be recorded in the public square. Spurred by protests\nin Charlottesville, VA in the summer of 2017 and moved forward\nduring the uprisings against police brutality in the summer of 2020,\ncities, institutions and impassioned individuals are pulling down\nand removing statues of Confederate leaders and other individuals\nimplicated in the histories of slavery, colonization and violence even as\nobjections are raised to these actions from both the left and the right.\nThis activism led to the formation of a commission to study New York\nCity’s built environment in fall 2017 and its resolution advocating both\ntaking down and putting up monuments here. Why are Monuments\nso important? How have they been used historically to assert political\nand social power? This course introduces the history of monument\nculture in the United States, focusing on monuments related to three\ncontroversial subjects: the Vietnam War, the Confederacy, and the\n“discovery” of America. We will study when, by whom, and in what\nform these monuments were erected and how artists and audiences\nof the past and present have responded to them.

The ﬁrst half of the class\nattends to two tendencies of the 1940s–1970s, abstraction and\nconceptualism, lionized through a slew of acclaimed group and solo\nexhibitions organized across the hemisphere in the last twenty years.\nWe will analyze these two tendencies in the distinct social, political,\nand economic contexts of their emergence in various “centers” of the\ncontinent paying special attention to the ideologies of modernization,\nprogress, and economic development; political upheavals including\nviolent dictatorships and other crises; artists’ relationship to Western\nEuropean and U.S. cultural centers, and transnational circulation\nnetworks; and the role of art institutions. To this end, we will pay\nspecial attention to how these trends have been historicized to date,\nand to what ends. The second half of the class will examine practices\nsince the mid-1970s to the present in a comparative perspective: one,\nthrough the lens of identity politics and, two, analyzing the dynamics\nof the increased global dissemination of works from Latin America and\nby Latin-American descendants.

Through the close visual analysis of images and\nobjects, the careful reading of primary sources, and the strategic\nengagement with recent scholarship, we will study how what and\nwho is “American” have been deﬁned and redeﬁned over the past\nthree centuries. In 2024, the course will be organized into four large\nthematic units focusing on the relationships between visual culture\nand a) materials and material practices, b) a) social and political\nidentities, c) nature and the environment, and d) cultural institutions\nand public spaces.

We will examine the role of art and so-called art in the\nheterogeneous cultures across the continent and their role in the\nconstruction of its diverse regional identities and their attendant\nhistorical narratives, including the incorporation of Pre-Columbian\nand folk cultures. We will discuss the tensions between religious\nand secular, imperial, proto-nationalist, and nationalist visions for\nthe function of arts and culture in its various regions.

This class is for artists who want to construct their own sense\nof time, punctuation, and duration, as well as those looking to discover\nthe visual and audio aesthetics of their generation. How does a feeling\nbecome an image, and what sound does it make? What are our media\naesthetics and skins? Is there a way to address the optical beyond the\neye and engage what we currently consider secondary senses, take our\nbodies back?

On the one hand,\nthe course considers exhibitions as a crucial tool of cultural diplomacy,\nwhich seek to position and/or reposition cities, regions, and even entire\nnations or “peoples” on the international scene. Thus, we will explore\nhow the artistic interests vested in exhibition-making intersect with\nother—political, economic, ideological, and cultural—interests. We will\nconsider those intersections paying special attention to the shifts in\npolitical relations and tensions during and after the Cold War, including\nthe moment of decolonization in Africa; the moment commonly\nunderstood as “globalization” and associated with the expansion of the\nneoliberal capitalism after 1989; and, ﬁnally, the current moment of the\nplanetary crisis. This expansive view of the “global contemporary art”\nwill allow us to distinguish different impetuses behind internationalism\nand globalism that not only seek to establish hegemony, artistic or\notherwise, but also look for the means to forge transnational dialogues\nand solidarities. On the other hand, this class seeks to illuminate how\ncertain artistic idioms and approaches developed after World War II\nachieved primacy that influences artistic production to this day. To\nthis end, we will examine the rise of a “visionary curator” as a theorist\nand tastemaker. We will also explore how more recent exhibitions\nhave sought to expand the geography of the “canonized” post-WWII\nart movements and valorize artistic production conceived outside of\nthe so-called “West.” In addition to weekly brief writing assignments\n(150–300 words each), both in and outside of class, the students in\nthe course will reconceive the installation of one of MoMA’s permanent\ncollection galleries (1940s-70s or 1970s-present) and produce a\npodcast that provides the rationale for the reinstallation in form of\ndialogue\nFall 2024: AHIS BC3428\nCourse\nNumber\nSection/Call\nNumber\nTimes/Location Instructor Points Enrollment\nAHIS 3428 001/00088 T Th 11:40am - 12:55pm \n504 Diana Center\nDorota Biczel 4.00 40/60", "source": "pdfs/barnard 2024-2025.pdf"}

This course studies theories of clothing\nfrom the perspectives of art history, anthropology, psychology,\neconomics, sociology, design, and sustainability. Issues to be\nstudied include gender roles, craft traditions, global textile trade,\nroyal sumptuary law, the history of European fashion, dissident or\ndisruptive styles, blockbuster museum costume exhibitions, and the\nenvironmental consequences of what we wear today.

Rather than attempt comprehensively to review every aspect of\nphotography and its legacies in the nineteenth, twentieth and twenty-\nﬁrst centuries, the course will instead trace signiﬁcant developments\nthrough a series of case studies. Some of the latter will focus on\nindividuals, genres or movements, and others on various discourses\nof the photographic image.  Particular attention will be placed on\nmethodological and theoretical concerns pertaining to the medium.\nSpring 2025: AHIS BC3673\nCourse\nNumber\nSection/Call\nNumber\nTimes/Location Instructor Points Enrollment\nAHIS 3673 001/00010 T Th 2:40pm - 3:55pm \n504 Diana Center\nAlexander\nAlberro\n4 46/60\nAHIS BC3674 Art since 1945. 3 points.\nBC: Fulﬁllment of General Education Requirement: The Visual and\nPerforming Arts (ART). \nNot offered during 2023-2024 academic year.\nIntroduction to the history of art in post-war Europe and the\nUnited States from 1945 to the present, emphasizing questions of\nmethodology of modernist studies and the diversity of theoretical\napproaches.", "source": "pdfs/barnard 2024-2025.pdf"}

We will\nconsider artists' responses to rapid modernization, debates over\ncultural identity, and the ever-changing role of \"tradition\" in modern art\npractice. We will also discuss the impact of natural disaster and war\non the arts, and the role of art in mediating social conflict. There are\nno prerequisites, but the survey of Japanese art history and classes in\nmodern Japanese studies would provide useful background.\nAHIS BC3698 American Monument Culture. 4 points.\nClass will meet twice a week plus digital workshops to be arranged.\nThe nation is currently caught up in a vital debate about how historical\nﬁgures and events should be recorded in the public square.  Cities,\ninstitutions and impassioned individuals are pulling down and\nremoving statues of Confederate leaders and other individuals\nimplicated in the history of slavery even as objections are raised to\nthese actions from both the left and the right.  This activism led to the\nformation of a commission to study New York City’s built environment\nand to commit to both taking down and putting up monuments here.\nWhy are Monuments so important?  How have they been used\nhistorically to assert political and social power?  This course introduces\nthe history of monument culture in the United States, focusing on\nmonuments related to three controversial subjects:  the Vietnam War,\nthe Confederacy, and the “discovery” of America.  We will study when,\nwhy, and in what form these monuments were erected and how artists\nand audiences of the past and present have responded to them.  The\nassignments will mirror this structure: through an essay and two\nmultimedia projects, students will both present an analysis of existing\nmonuments and make a proposal for new ones.\nClass meetings will combine lecture and discussion.  In addition,\nstudents must attend two two-hour digital workshop.  We will take two\nﬁeld trips and assignments will involve visits to offsite locations in New\nYork City.\nAHIS BC3831 Museums of New York City. 4.00 points.\nNew York City is home to one of the world’s best museum ecologies.\nThis seminar studies that ecology by museum type, against the\nbackdrop of the city’s cultural, economic, and social history. How\ncan theories of collecting explain different museum types? How do\nmuseums anchor municipal identity?

At an art historical juncture in which medium-\nspeciﬁcity and national traditions are increasingly rare and at a\npolitical juncture attuned to unequal histories of race, class and\ngender, how to engage with these works? What is the potential for\nsubverting longstanding assumptions about the role of art by reframing\nthe Old Masters through innovative juxtaposition, installation and\ninterpretation by contemporary artists, curators and the public? This\ncourse, led by a curator in European Paintings at The Metropolitan\nMuseum of Art, takes place primarily at the museum.

Design makes and unmakes\ndesires on a global scale. It organizes our lives—from the way we move\nto the interface that tracks our movements. We’ve trained for the end\nfor a while now, apocalypse is announced on every image channel. In\na world, soon impossible to physically inhabit, the things we consume\nnow consume us. The stakes have never been higher. To make a new\nworld, we must use design. Our planet need not be disposed. It is\nan infrastructure for another one. To make contact with it we need\nto understand design as a value system for propelling possibility,\nnot possession. The designed world requires new relation to things\nand fullness of use. As we read, write, experience and make our own\nprojects, Designing Design helps us: acquire intimate knowledge of\nhow we got here, recognize our historical allies and foes, and foster\nimagination and intelligence to live and make responsibly. This course\nrequires no prior design experience\nAHIS BC3844 Revolution and Art. 4.00 points.\nIn 1789, a French revolution shook the government foundation of\nEurope, and with it, all the arts. The principles of monarchy were\nrejected, women gained unprecedented freedoms, and French slavery\nwas abolished. How did the arts express those upheavals? By 1805,\nareaction against the Revolution. An emperor crowned himself,\nwomen’s rights were revoked slavery was reinstated. How did the arts\ndeal with this backlash?\nAHIS BC3846 Designing Design II. 4.00 points.\nThe way an environment is made remains deeply embedded within it.\nOur environments shape us like our families, they nourish and educate\nus, they prejudice us. What if they were not a given? If our relationship\nto them was something we choose and shape, less of a blood relation,\nmore of a lifelong friendship? A friend is an equal with their own\nagency and act as, a partner in play and life. Friendship is a place\nwhere we interact, welcome each-other and make the world together.\nThe common task of this class is to devise a studio for making living\nenvironments to study how we could make, exhibit and live with art.\nThrough a variety of individual and group readings and assignments,\nin-class case-studies and interviews we will test our preconceptions\nof space and time so that we may experience and inspire the state of\nbeing present.

Who can make art?\nWho is art for? Should art be public? Should art be free? How should art\nbe traded? What desires should it power?

Initially cultivated to\nbring Inuit people into the cash economy as part of a broader colonial\nprocess of disrupting seasonal migrations and subsistence lifeways,\nmodern Inuit sculpture has developed in ways that increasingly\ncenter community leadership and assertions of artistic and cultural\nsovereignty in the face of environmental, economic, political and\naesthetic change. The assignments for this class foreground writings,\nﬁlms, and artworks by Inuit scholars, artists, and community leaders.\nIn preparation of the exhibition, we will and also work closely with the\nBrooklyn Museum staff to gain an understanding of their collection of\nInuit sculpture and the staff roles in caring for it\nAHIS BC3865 Paris: Capital of the 19th Century. 4 points.\nAPPLICATION DUE TO 826 SCHERMERHORN.Not offered during\n2023-2024 academic year.\nThe Impressionist painting movement was committed to the\nrepresentation of modern life.  What did modern life mean to the\nImpressionists, and how did they represent it?  How did Impressionist\npaintings interpret mid-nineteenth-century ideas about empirical\nobservation, the re-design of Paris, urban spectacles, fashion, and the\nnew reproducible media of their moment?  Each student will choose\none painting in the Met collection on which to give two presentations\nand write a ﬁnal paper.

They create\nobjects that echo the basic elements of the medium—light and lens\n—and use altered or expired photo paper. They assemble physical\nalbums, ﬁctional archives, and sculptural installations. They play\nwith the circulation of images online, or share virtual experiences\nof spaces via printed images. In this course, we will look projects\nfrom recent decades that examine and expand the parameters of\nphotography, including works by Liz Deschenes, David Horvitz, Zoe\nLeonard, Allison Rossiter, Stephanie Syjuco, and Wolfgang Tillmans.\nVia writing exercises, material experiments, and generative prompts,\nstudents will create their own research-informed projects that push\nphotography beyond the screen or frame and into the material world\nSpring 2025: AHIS BC3867\nCourse\nNumber\nSection/Call\nNumber\nTimes/Location Instructor Points Enrollment\nAHIS 3867 001/00012 M 10:10am - 2:00pm \n402 Diana Center\nMira Dayal 3.00 6/18\nAHIS BC3868 Tokyo. 4.00 points.\nThis seminar will take an interdisciplinary approach to the history of\nthe complex and dynamic city of Tokyo from the mid-19th century to\nthe present. The class will discuss the impact that industrialization and\nsustained migration have had on the city’s housing and infrastructure\nand will examine the often equivocal and incomplete urban planning\nprojects that have attempted to address these changes from the Ginza\nBrick Town of the 1870s, to the reconstruction efforts after the Great\nKanto Earthquake. We will examine the impact of and response to\nnatural disasters and war. We will discuss the emergence of so-called\n“new town” suburban developments since the 1960s and the ways\nin which these new urban forms reshaped daily life. We will discuss\nthe bucolic prints of the 1910s through the 1930s that obscured the\ncrowding, pollution and political violence and compare them with the\nmore politically engaged prints and journalistic photographs of the\nera. We will also consider the apocalyptic imagery that is so pervasive\nin the treatment of Tokyo in post-war ﬁlm and anime.

It\ncenters the projects concerned with the politics of land and water\nin the aftermath of colonialism in the Americas, paying special\nattention to the work of those dispossessed by colonial projects—\nthat is, Indigenous, Black, mestizo, and other racialized, diasporic,\nand/or migrant-descendant artists (i.e. Latinxs in the United States).\nFor one, these practices are contextualized within the larger history\nof land/water representations and their attendant, often explicitly\nnationalist, ideologies as the attempts to remediate their effects and\naftereffects. Two, these practices are analyzed vis-à-vis a wide range\nof anticolonial, postcolonial, and decolonial theories developed in the\nAmericas and beyond in order to facilitate their historicization and\ntheorization. It is the historical development of these theories that\nserves as a structuring tool for the course. In that vein, we consider\nthe methodological question of how and when “theory” can be useful\nto art historical analysis, and how the concepts operative in the\npresent can be applied and useful to the past, on the one hand. On\nthe other, the seminar posits our current moment as a discrete era\nwithin a long history of struggles for self-determination variegated\nby distinct understandings of what the “Americas” are and how they\nwere “made,” both of matter, peoples, and ideas. Simultaneously, it\ninvestigates concepts of time and temporality in order to illuminate\nand consider distinct understandings of human and other-than-human\nrelations fundamental to the making and inhabiting of a “place.” Some\nof the authors discussed include Frantz Fanon, Aimé Césaire, Gayatri\nChakravorty Spivak, Aníbal Quijano, Walter Mignolo, María Lugones,\nSylvia Wynter, Rita Segato, Juan López Intzin, Glen Coulthard, Sheryl\nLightfoot, Gloria Anzaldúa, and Eve Tuck and Wayne K.

It rejected the dress rules\nand materials that had signaled static social rank in favor of mobile\nself-expression through consumer choice. The change was so radical\nfor women that it was partially reversed after 1804, but for men it\nendured.\nAHIS BC3931 The Body in Medieval Art. 4 points.\nNot offered during 2023-2024 academic year.\nThis seminar explores how the body, broadly deﬁned, was represented,\nstage, and theorized in the art of medieval Europe.  The bodies\ndiscussed include human, divine, demonic, fleshly, corruptible, saintly,\nsexed, and raced bodies.  The seminar will thematically approach these\ndifferent body genres via painting, sculpture, architecture, and the\nprecious arts.\nAHIS BC3933 BUOYANCY. 4.00 points.\n“Be like a duck. Calm on the surface, but always paddling like the\ndickens underneath.”,Michael Caine , We do not live our own desires.\nPressing ourselves into heavy molds not made for our bodies\ncompresses us, tears our skin, and bruises our features. It is hard\nto breathe. We sink. Weight harbors the downward pull. It attaches\nitself in many ways but there are countless ways to set it down, to be\nfree. This takes practice and skill. The common task of this visual arts\nseminar is to distinguish ourselves from the weight we carry. Through a\nvariety or reading, writing, and making activities we shall seek out and\ncontact levity: that gravity that changes our bodies, make us light of\ntouch, aerates and propels us toward the state of buoyancy.

The historical domain of this\ncourse is within the last century and its geographical spectrum is\nglobal. European critical thinkers are included in this course but\nnot privileged. Thinkers from Asia, Africa, Europe, North, South,\nand Latin America, are examined here in chronological order and in\nequal democratic footing with each other. This course as a result\nis decidedly cross-cultural, one step forward towards de-alienating\ncritical thinkers from around the globe and the issues they address\nwithout pigeonholing them as something “other” or “different.” The\ncourse is designed and offered in the true spirit of the “Global Core.”\nThe purpose of the course is to reach for the common denominator\nof serious critical thinking about the fate of our humanity and the\nhealth of our social relations in an increasingly fragile world—where\nthe false binaries of “the West” and “the Rest” no longer hold. The\nroster of critical thinkers we will examine is by no means exhaustive\nbut representative. Any number of other critical thinkers can be added\nto this roster but none of those we will examine can be excluded from\nthem. The course is divided into thirteen successive weeks and for\neach week a number of seminal, original, and groundbreaking texts are\nidentiﬁed. Each week we will examine selected passages from these\ntexts.

In the wake of the formation of\nthe modern academic disciplines in the nineteenth century and their\nglobal spread, it became difﬁcult to understand the power and glory\nof older western philology, and its striking parallels with other pre-\nand early modern forms of scholarship around the globe. This class\nseeks to create a new comparative framework for understanding how\nearlier generations made sense of the texts that they valued, and how\ntheir practices provide still-vital models for us at a time of upheaval\nin the format and media of texts and in our scholarly approaches\nto them. Students will encounter key ﬁelds of philology—textual\ncriticism, lexicography, grammar, and, above all, commentary—not in\nthe abstract but as instantiated in relation to four foundational works—\nthe Confucian Analects, the Rāmāya#a of Vālmīki, the Aeneid, and the\nTale of Genji—and the scholarly traditions that grew up around them.\nWe are never alone when we grapple with the basic question of how\nto read texts whose meaning is unclear to us.

After a brief review\nof the three cases, the course will adopt a thematic approach, ﬁrst\nreviewing the character of the state, including national mythologies,\nthe military and the relations between capital city and provinces.

Besides\n“literary writings” (wenzhang ##) like poetry and prose, literati also\nengaged in calligraphy, painting, and antiquarianism under the umbrella\nterm of “literary or cultural arts” (wenyi ##). In turn, creation and\nappreciation of artwork (“cultural or civil objects,” wenwu ##) were\nintrinsic to the leisurely and aesthetic life of literati community and\nfurther established their self-identity. Covering the long trajectory\nof imperial China over 3,000 years, this course reveals the birth and\ngrowth of literati culture from the beginning, to its full bloom since\nthe Northern Song dynasty (960–1126), to the shifting patterns\nacross the second millennium. In particular, this course takes an\ninterdisciplinary approach to literati culture, introducing intellectual and\npoetic discourses, socio-historical contexts, literary criticism, visual\nand material culture, to envision a “common ground” for their civil\nworld. Textual, visual sources plus material objects are meant to have\nconversations with each other in this course. Important issues include\nhistorical transformations of the elite class, cultural geography in\ndifferent eras, materiality and visuality of elite calligraphy and painting,\nliterati self-expression through aesthetic practice, the roles of the court\nand literati in producing and preserving art, as well as other relevant\nissues such as gender studies, vernacular literature, and commodity\nsociety.

Our\nfocus will be on the appetites of food hunger and sexual desire, and\nhow Chinese Buddhist teachings propose to manage these. Food and\nsex are separate domains of experience, but as the primary objects\nof bodily appetites, they are analogous. Eating and sex both involve\na direct and substantive interaction with the material world that is\ndriven by powerful desires. In Buddhist teachings, these desires are\nsaid to bind us to the cycle of rebirth (sa#sāra) and to shape the\nactions (karma), both mental and corporeal, that constitute our moral\nengagement with the phenomenal world. Hence it is important to\nknow how a Buddhist on the path out of suffering is to manage these\nactivities. What do monastic codes stipulate? What disciplines did lay\nBuddhists undertake? How are transgressions identiﬁed and handled?\nHow do ancient Chinese and Daoist ideas inform the development\nof Chinese Buddhist attitudes toward sex and diet? How did Chinese\nBuddhist monastics come to adopt a meatless diet? How do religions\nuse food and sex as tools for determining one's ritual purity (i.e.,\nmoral worth)? We will explore these and related topics. Despite the\ncommon perception of Buddhism as a world-denying religion focused\non transcending bodily needs, Chinese Buddhists (and their Indian\nor Central Asian counterparts) engaged in numerous body practices\nwith worldly beneﬁt, while at the same time mitigating the dangers of\ndesire through various doctrinal and practical means.

But things\naren’t as simple as they appear. This course explores the intertwined\nquestions of “Chinese” desire and the desire for China. Avoiding\nreductionist understandings of desire as either a universal natural\nhuman attribute or a particular Chinese cultural trait, we will track the\nproduction and management of desire within a complex global ﬁeld.\nDrawing on ethnographies, ﬁlms, short stories, and psychoanalytic and\npostcolonial theory, this course will explore the shifting ﬁgure of desire\nacross the Maoist and post-Maoist eras by examining how academics,\ngovernment ofﬁcials, intellectuals, and artists have represented\nChinese needs, wants and fantasies. From state leaders’ attempts to\nimprove the “quality” of the country’s population to citizens’ dreams of\nhome ownership, from sexualized desire to hunger for food, drugs and\nother commodities, we will attend to the continuities and disjunctures\nof recent Chinese history by tracking how desire in China has been\nconceptualized and refracted through local and global encounters\nFall 2024: EAAS GU4840\nCourse\nNumber\nSection/Call\nNumber\nTimes/Location Instructor Points Enrollment\nEAAS 4840 001/00589 W 10:10am - 12:00pm \n214 Milbank Hall\nNicholas\nBartlett\n4.00 12/20\nPOLS GU4871 China's Foreign Relations. 4 points.\nThis course will review and analyze the foreign policy of the People's\nRepublic of China from 1949 to the present.

Students occupied university campuses\nacross the country - in the most dramatic cases storming lecture-\nhalls, building barricades and wielding bamboo spears in clashes\nwith the police, counter?protestors and each other. These protests\ncoincided with a wave of other campus occupations around the\nworld, including in the US, France, Germany, Czechoslovakia, and\nChina. In Japan they marked the culmination of a decade of protest\nagainst a range of issues including (but not limited to) the Vietnam\nWar, colonialism, nuclear weapons, pollution, inflation, consumerism,\ncapitalism, corruption, labour abuses, police brutality, authoritarianism,\ncensorship, patriarchy, conformity and boredom. This course explores\nwhy students protested and what methods they used. It asks what\neffect the protests had in terms of goals achieved, unintended\nconsequences, and longer-lasting social and cultural legacies. How did\nprotestors’ motivations change over time, and how did Japanese state\nand society accommodate, repress or subvert the movements? How\ndid the protests and subsequent crackdown transform universities\nas spaces for learning, research and socialization? What alliances did\nstudents seek to forge with peers, activists, guerillas and governments\noverseas? Was there such a thing as a global 1968, and if so was\nJapan a part of it?

Dispensing with this cliché, this course\ninvites students to engage with North Korean history using a variety\nof primary and secondary sources.

Tibetan emperors adopted Buddhism\nfrom India around the eighth century, which sounds like a long time\nago now, but by that time Buddhism was already well established in\nparts of South, Southeast, Central, and East Asia. In addition to being\nknown as a tradition of renunciants and forest dwelling philosophers,\nBuddhism was associated with cosmopolitanism—literacy, the arts,\narchitecture, higher education and beyond. Tibetan rulers, like so many\nrulers before them, turned to Buddhism after amassing power through\nwarfare and violence, and they became interested in Buddhism’s\nmethods for cultivating wisdom and compassion as antidotes to\nignorance and selﬁshness. They were also curious about whether\nBuddhism could help justify and support their claims to power.\nBecause Buddhism was already a complex system, Tibetans were able\nto uniquely integrate all three of the major traditions of Theravada,\nMahayana, and Vajrayana Buddhism. Thanks to the hard work of\nTibetan and Indian translators and artists with imperial support,\nmonks and nuns followed the rules of the earliest disciples of Buddha,\nphilosophers pored over Indian Buddhist treatises, and ritualists\nﬁne-tuned the tantric, esoteric, intensive path to liberation from\ndissatisfaction and suffering. The new expressions of Buddhism that\nemerged in Tibet have shaped religion, education, literary production,\nthe arts, and language across a massive and diverse swath of Asia,\nfrom northern India to Nepal, Bhutan, Mongolia, and areas of Western\nChina. More recently, Tibetan Buddhism has spread across the globe.\nIn this course, by analyzing primary textual sources in translation as\nwell as visual and material culture, we will investigate the history and\npractice of Tibetan Buddhism in all its complexity, from its earliest\norigins to the present.

However, there is\nsubstantial variation in the contours of racism across time and space.\nRelatedly, strategies for resistance to racism also vary signiﬁcantly.

Tibetan emperors adopted Buddhism\nfrom India around the eighth century, which sounds like a long time\nago now, but by that time Buddhism was already well established in\nparts of South, Southeast, Central, and East Asia. In addition to being\nknown as a tradition of renunciants and forest dwelling philosophers,\nBuddhism was associated with cosmopolitanism—literacy, the arts,\narchitecture, higher education and beyond. Tibetan rulers, like so many\nrulers before them, turned to Buddhism after amassing power through\nwarfare and violence, and they became interested in Buddhism’s\nmethods for cultivating wisdom and compassion as antidotes to\nignorance and selﬁshness. They were also curious about whether\nBuddhism could help justify and support their claims to power.\nBecause Buddhism was already a complex system, Tibetans were able\nto uniquely integrate all three of the major traditions of Theravada,\nMahayana, and Vajrayana Buddhism. Thanks to the hard work of\nTibetan and Indian translators and artists with imperial support,\nmonks and nuns followed the rules of the earliest disciples of Buddha,\nphilosophers pored over Indian Buddhist treatises, and ritualists\nﬁne-tuned the tantric, esoteric, intensive path to liberation from\ndissatisfaction and suffering. The new expressions of Buddhism that\nemerged in Tibet have shaped religion, education, literary production,\nthe arts, and language across a massive and diverse swath of Asia,\nfrom northern India to Nepal, Bhutan, Mongolia, and areas of Western\nChina. More recently, Tibetan Buddhism has spread across the globe.\nIn this course, by analyzing primary textual sources in translation as\nwell as visual and material culture, we will investigate the history and\npractice of Tibetan Buddhism in all its complexity, from its earliest\norigins to the present.

How did a man with such views come\nto have such an immense effect on history? In some ways, Gandhi\nis an excellent entry into the complex history of modern India - its\ncontradictions, achievements, failures, possibilities. This course will\nbe primarily a course on social theory, focusing on texts and discursive\nexchanges between various perceptions of modernity in India. It will\nhave two parts: the ﬁrst part will be based on reading Gandhi’s own\nwritings; the second, on the writings of his main interlocutors. It is\nhoped that through these exchanges students will get a vivid picture\nof the intellectual ferment in modern India, and the main lines of social\nand political thought that deﬁne its intellectual culture.

We begin with the rise and fall of the Mughal\nEmpire, and examine why and how the East India Company came\nto rule India in the eighteenth century. As the term progresses, we\nwill investigate the objectives of British colonial rule in India and\nwe will explore the nature of colonial modernity. The course then\nturns to a discussion of anti-colonial sentiment, both in the form of\noutright revolt, and critiques by early nationalists.

What is the understanding of the\nreligious that seems to be the operative factor in these events? Is it\na singular concept of religion or are there different connotations of\nthis category? For instance, how do we understand religion when it\nbifurcates the women’s movement between Western ‘secular’ women\nand non-Western ‘Muslim’ women? Is it the same concept when we\nidentify ‘religion’ as the basis for the harmonious coexistence of Hindus\nand Muslims among certain non-elite communities in India? In this\ncourse, we ask if it even possible to understand, ‘religious’ events\nin the modern political world, without asking what other categories\nimplicitly inform our notion of the religious – such as, gender, caste,\nculture, race and historiography. We move beyond the strict dichotomy,\nof religion and secularism, as something given and unproblematic.\nDrawing from examples and events in modern South Asia as well as\nother postcolonial contexts, we attempt to respond to the concepts,\ncontradictions, and dilemmas that accompany the question of when\nand how the religious becomes the political in the modern world.\n Our weekly sessions will be devoted to reading texts from various\ndisciplines and analyzing how the main argument is formulated and\nhow that relates to a critique of the concept of religion in modern\nSouth Asia. Some weeks the scholarly texts will be supplemented by\nprimary texts/case studies that will serve as direct demonstration of\nthe problems that will be explored in the course. The engagement with\nsources from various disciplines will expose us to interdisciplinary\ncontent as well as diverse methods of critical analysis and\nargumentation. It will also help acquire the practice of identifying the\ncentral argument of the text, understand how the broad argument is\nactually formulated through smaller steps, and achieve the analytic\nskill to critically locate that single argument within a larger body of\nscholarship.\nPOLS UN3112 GANDHI, KING # POLS OF NONVIOLENCE. 4.00 points.\nSince Gandhi’s experiments in mass satyagraha over a century ago,\nnonviolence has become a staple of protest politics across the globe.\nFrom the Occupy movements to the Arab Spring to Movement for Black\nLives, it might even be entering a new phase of revitalization. At the\nsame time, what exactly nonviolence is and what it can accomplish\nin politics is very much under debate. This course aims to understand\nthe politics of nonviolence by examining the political ideas and\npolitical careers of its most well-known twentieth-century advocates,\nM.K. Gandhi and Martin Luther King, Jr. Though still venerated as\nfounding ﬁgures of nonviolent protest, Gandhi and King have come to\nbe remembered in ways that can misconstrue how they understood\nand practiced nonviolent politics. To many, Gandhi is a saintly idealist,\nwho wanted to imbue politics with the spirit of ahimsa, truth, and\nconscience. Likewise, King is taken to be a spokesman for interracial\nbrotherhood and Christian love. While partly true, these images also\ndownplay the political side of their nonviolence – the techniques\nof organizing and strategies of protest that made their movements\nsuccessful. We will examine the evolution of Gandhi’s and King’s\npolitical thinking in relation to the movements they led – the Indian\nindependence movement and the civil rights movement in the US. We\nwill consider how the theory and practice of nonviolence evolved and\nchanged as it moved from one context to another.

First, we will ask\nwhy imperialism? explaining the different reasons and dynamics for\nimperialist expansion in the three regions. In the second theme, we will\nexamine the political economy of colonial rule and how it manifested\ndifferently over time and space. In the third theme, we will explore\nsocial change, resistance, and questions of labor in colonial settings.\nThe course will also serve to introduce students to using primary\nmaterials in their studies, using documents varying from contracts,\nlaws, newspaper articles, reports, and correspondences.

Within the ﬁrst hundred years, even more claimants to imperial\npower in India – the British, the French, the Rajput, the Maratha – were\nengaged in political negotiations, resistance and accommodation with\nthe Mughal. We will follow the course of the development of Mughal\npolitical thought, economic and environmental impact and courtly\nculture through to their ofﬁcial demise in 1857. The ﬁrst four emperors\nof Mughal India left various accounts for us. Babur (r. 1525–1530),\nthe founder of the dynasty, wrote an autobiography. Memoirs of the\nsecond, Humayun (r. 1530–1556), were written by his sister, and others\nin his army. The third, Akbar (r. 1556–1605) was the subject of the most\namazing regnal history-- written by his minister and aide Abu'l Fazl. His\nson Jahangir (r. 1605–1627), recorded his daily activities and thoughts\nin his own journal that was published by him. To best engage with this\ncomplex universe, we will use the semantic vocabulary of ‘seeing’. This\ncourse will delve into how Mughal emperors saw their world and how\nthey narrated it. This course is almost exclusively focused on primary\nreadings. We will read large portions of the texts written by the Mughal\nelite.

Ambedkar is arguably one of Columbia University’s most\nillustrious alumni, and a democratic thinker and constitutional lawyer\nwho had enormous impact in shaping India, the world’s largest\ndemocracy. As is well known, Ambedkar came to Columbia University\nin July 1913 to start a doctoral program in Political Science. He\ngraduated in 1915 with a Masters degree, and got his doctorate from\nColumbia in 1927 after having studied with some of the great ﬁgures of\ninterwar American thought including Edwin Seligman, James Shotwell,\nHarvey Robinson, and John Dewey. This course follows the model of\nthe Columbia University and Slavery course and draws extensively\non the relevant holdings and resources of Columbia’s RBML, [Rare\nBooks and Manuscript Library] Burke Library (Union Theological\nSeminar), and the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture\namong others to explore a set of relatively understudied links between\nAmbedkar, Columbia University, and the intellectual history of the\ninterwar period. Themes include: the development of the disciplines at\nColumbia University and their relationship to new paradigms of social\nscientiﬁc study; the role of historical comparison between caste and\nrace in producing new models of scholarship and political solidarity;\nlinks between ﬁgures such as Ambedkar, Lala Lajpat Rai, W.

In the wake of the formation of\nthe modern academic disciplines in the nineteenth century and their\nglobal spread, it became difﬁcult to understand the power and glory\nof older western philology, and its striking parallels with other pre-\nand early modern forms of scholarship around the globe. This class\nseeks to create a new comparative framework for understanding how\nearlier generations made sense of the texts that they valued, and how\ntheir practices provide still-vital models for us at a time of upheaval\nin the format and media of texts and in our scholarly approaches\nto them. Students will encounter key ﬁelds of philology—textual\ncriticism, lexicography, grammar, and, above all, commentary—not in\nthe abstract but as instantiated in relation to four foundational works—\nthe Confucian Analects, the Rāmāya#a of Vālmīki, the Aeneid, and the\nTale of Genji—and the scholarly traditions that grew up around them.\nWe are never alone when we grapple with the basic question of how\nto read texts whose meaning is unclear to us.

Grounding\nourselves in this formative space of the secular, we will study the\nconstitutive nature of imperialism within the secular by examining\nthe disciplining and conscripting role of Orientalism and the colonial\nstate. Though noting these changes produced by colonial rule, this\ncourse also explores the arguments scholars of South Asia have made\ndistinguishing between “secularisms” and the production of a tolerant\nand cosmopolitan South Asian orientation. In conjunction and against\nthese possibilities, rather than consider the religious retrograde or\ncommunal, we will consider the continual striving toward political\nautonomy through disputation in the parameters of a given tradition\n—which resist incorporation into a broader pluralist or syncretic Indic\nmodel.\nRELI GU4304 Krishna. 4 points.\nCC/GS/SEAS: Partial Fulﬁllment of Global Core Requirement \nStudy of a single deity in the Hindu pantheon as illuminated in art,\nmusic, dance, drama, theological treatises, patterns of ritual, and\ntexts both classic and modern.

In this course, we\nwill not only learn about Islamic thought and practice in the history\nand present of this important part of the Islamic world; we will also\nreflect on issues that, while grounded in the Southeast Asian context,\nillustrate a variety of key Islamic Studies issues. The ﬁrst half of the\ncourse will provide a historical overview over the development of Islam\nin Southeast Asia while the second half will focus on contemporary\nissues. The Malay-Indonesian world, home to 90# of Southeast\nAsia’s Muslims, will be our primary focus.

We try to make sense of these by\ninterpreting them. The art or science of interpretation – “hermeneutics”\nafter Hermes – has a long history in Asia and in the West. Buddhism\nitself has a tradition of hermeneutics, as does each of the Western\nreligious traditions and Western philosophy and law, starting with\nPlato and Aristotle, becoming “romantic” with Schleiermacher, and\n“modern” with Heidegger, Gadamer, and Ricoeur. Today’s Western\nhermeneutics has become largely de-regionalized from speciﬁc subject\nareas, and has been extended to the interpretation of all human\nexperience. After a grounding in traditional Buddhist and Western\nhermeneutic principles, we will focus on a number of aspects of\nBuddhism, including the central question of whether there is a “self”\nor not, and on esoteric Buddhist yoga, Tantra, central to several of the\nbetter-known forms of Buddhism today, including Tibetan Buddhism.\nHere we will witness the confluence and, sometimes, collision of\ntraditional Buddhist and Tantric hermeneutics focusing in large part\non “spiritual” concerns, and the Western tradition, with its emphasis on\neconomics, power, and gender. In thinking about which interpretations\nare “right” -- indeed, whether any interpretation can be “right,” and,\nif so, \"how much?\" -- we will consider the cultures in which these\nscriptures and practices originated, as well as ourselves and our own\ncontemporary perspectives, insights, presuppositions and prejudices.\nA primary concern of hermeneutics is the interpretation of so-called\n\"objective\" physical and subjective mental realities. In thinking about\nthe hermeneutics of outer and inner time and space, towards the\nend of the semester we will consider whether the \"objective\" and the\n\"subjective\" intersect, how much, and look at some descriptions of\nquantum mechanics and the role of observation of physical reality\nthere, and analogize and contrast those to and with some Buddhist\nsystems of philosophy and practice\nFall 2024: RELI GU4318\nCourse\nNumber\nSection/Call\nNumber\nTimes/Location Instructor Points Enrollment\nRELI 4318 001/10952 Th 12:10pm - 2:00pm \n201 80 Claremont\nDavid Kittay 4.00 17/25", "source": "pdfs/barnard 2024-2025.pdf"}

Throughout the history of Islam, Suﬁ ideas, practices, and\ninstitutions have borne a complex, intimate, and sometimes fraught\nrelationship with other aspects of Islamic tradition and practice, a\nrelationship that has also been profoundly impacted by Orientalist\nscholarship in the colonial period and by global reformist currents in\nthe postcolonial period. This seminar for advanced undergraduates\nand graduate students is an interdisciplinary investigation of how\nSuﬁsm has been affected by the historical, sociocultural, political, and\neveryday environments in which is it experienced and practiced, with\na particular focus on South Asia. Eclectic in approach, we will begin\nby considering how Suﬁsm has been construed and even constructed\nby scholars, considering how modern notions of the self, religion, and\nthe political have shaped scholarly understandings of what Suﬁsm\nis. Focusing on bodily practices and well known individual Suﬁs who\nlived in South Asia during different historical periods, we will use them\nas a vehicle for understanding Suﬁ experience within the context of\nthe evolving Suﬁ orders within speciﬁc local spaces. We will consider\nwhy Suﬁsm has become such a target of controversy and ambivalence\namong Muslims in the modern world and trace some of the changing\ncontroversies and tensions that Suﬁs have struggled with over time,\nfocusing on their understandings of self, society and reality\nASST GU4600 JUDAISM # CHRISTIANITY S.ASIA. 3.00 points.\nAn introduction to the indigenous traditions of Judaism and\nChristianity in the subcontinent, with attention to historical\ndevelopment, community diversity, cultural patterns, interactions with\nHindus and Muslims, and contemporary controversies over caste\nand conversion.

Though its main purpose will be to provide students with\nan understanding of politics after independence, it will argue,\nmethodologically, that this understanding should be based on a study\nof historical sociology – plotting long-terms shifts in the structure of\nsocial power.  The course will start with analyses of the structures of\npower and ideas about political legitimacy in pre-modern India, and\nthe transformations brought by colonialism into that order. After a\nbrief study of the nature of political order under the colonial state, the\ncourses will focus primarily on the history of the democratic state after\nindependence.\nSpring 2025: MDES GU4601\nCourse\nNumber\nSection/Call\nNumber\nTimes/Location Instructor Points Enrollment\nMDES 4601 001/11361 Th 2:10pm - 4:00pm \n606 Martin Luther King\nBuilding\nSudipta\nKaviraj\n4 14/25\nMDES GU4606 Hindu Nationalism. 4.00 points.\nSince the ascent of Narendra Modi as Prime Minister of India in\n2014, Hindu nationalism has dominated headlines concerning India\nacross the globe. However, the influence that Hindu nationalism\nhas had in shaping beliefs about citizenship, belonging, religion, and\nthe nation has a history that predates the Modi regime by around\na hundred and ﬁfty years. This class will examine the history of\nHindu nationalism from the nineteenth to the twenty-ﬁrst century by\nexamining primary texts and academic analysis. This class will not\nonly read the writings of key Hindu nationalist thinkers but will also\nexamine how different media and technologies have affected how\nHindu nationalists communicate with different publics.

The main questions\nthat we will address include: how have political, commercial, and\ncultural movements shaped what the diverse populations of South\nAsia listen to and how they listen? How have different forms of\nmedia shaped/ informed listening experiences in South Asia? How\ndo listening practices and cultures from the subcontinent differ from\nthose in other regions?

Of Timurid\nancestry, the earliest Mughal rulers drew upon the heritage of Central\nAsia in their ruling styles and cultural practices, but they would soon\nadapt to the complexities of their Indian milieu, which had longstanding\ntraditions that were a blend of Sanskrit and Persian, Hindu and Muslim\nidioms. European culture, whether ﬁltered through Jesuit sermons,\nitinerant merchants, or Flemish engravings, was also making inroads\ninto India during this period. This course is a broad cultural history\nof Mughal India as seen from a range of perspectives and sources.\nWe consider the Mughals’ major achievements in visual culture as\nmanifested in painting and architecture, as well as exploring diverse\ntopics in religion, literature, politics, and historiography. Yet another\napproach is to listen to the voices of the Mughal rulers as recorded in\ntheir memoirs, as well as investigating the signal contributions of the\ndynasty’s women.\nMDES GU4653 A History of Modern Pakistan. 4 points.\nThe course will examine the six \"eras\" that help deﬁne Pakistan's\nhistory, and will highlight political, economic and institutional\ndevelopments.  The completion of this course should prepare students\nfor further and more advanced work on South Asia.\nMDES GU4654 Gender, Power and Culture in Early Modern India. 4\npoints.\nExplores gender, culture, power in India, c. 1500-1800 by reading\ntheoretical works on gender and sexuality, historical scholarship\nrelevant to early modern India, and a variety of primary sources.\nTopics include morality, mysticism, devotion, desire, kingship, heroism,\nhomosocial relations, and homoerotic practices. The focus is largely\non Persianate contexts, in conversation with broader South Asian and\nIslamic studies. This discussion seminar is designed for graduate and\nadvanced undergraduate students, with some previous background in\nSouth Asian, Islamic, or gender studies.\nMDES GU4655 India after 1947: Democracy and Majoritarianism. 4.00\npoints.\nThis course will explore recent histories of post-independence India,\nfocusing on the ﬁrst three decades of independence (1947-1977)\nfollowing the end of British colonial rule. Until rather recently, most\nhistories of South Asia concluded with independence, casting,\nperhaps unconsciously, the end of British rule as the end of history\nin the region. However, in recent years, we have witnessed a boom\nof historical writing on post-independence India. In this class, we\nwill analyze this emerging scholarship and focus on the themes of\ndemocracy and majoritarianism. We will read about the establishment\nof universal franchise in 1950s India, the writing and implementation\nof the constitution, and the country’s experiments with various\neconomic plans. At the same time, we will study the Indian state’s\noften violent integration of regions originally outside Britain’s direct\ndomain, including the princely states of Kashmir and Hyderabad,\nand the development of what scholars have described as new forms\nof colonialism in the region after 1947. Likewise, we will study the\ngrowth of majoritarian ideologies and the continued struggle against\ncaste oppression, all while considering India’s place in the larger Cold\nWar. Throughout the class, we will remain attendant to aesthetic\ndevelopments in media and literature during this period. While the\ncourse focuses on India—or more speciﬁcally on various communities’\ninteractions with the Indian state—we will also study developments in\nPakistan (and Bangladesh after 1971) and other neighboring states,\nrecognizing that their shared histories did not end with Partition\nFall 2024: MDES GU4655\nCourse\nNumber\nSection/Call\nNumber\nTimes/Location Instructor Points Enrollment\nMDES 4655 001/15422 W 12:10pm - 2:00pm \n103 Knox Hall\nIsabel\nHuacuja\nAlonso\n4.00 13/20\nMDES GU4825 Indo-Islamic Culture in Literature. 4.00 points.\nThis course will focus on the Indo-Islamic literary traditions in South\nAsia, and particularly in what is now India and Pakistan, focusing\non Urdu literature from the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The\ncourse will emphasize the rhetorical and performative history of poetic\nforms in the subcontinent (including the forms of the Ghazal and\nNauha, among others) and will consider how classical poetic tropes\ncontinue to inform contemporary mass culture in India and Pakistan—\nparticularly in the song lyrics of Hindi/Bollywood cinema. The course\nwill also consider more contemporary prose genres of Urdu-language\nwriting (in English translation), including the literature of the Partition\nand the works of contemporary authors such as Naiyer Masud and\nSaima Iram. Through a comparative study of texts in different genres\nand at different moments in history, students will consider questions\nsuch as: What aspects of contemporary literary culture in India and\nPakistan can be traced to early establishment of Islamic culture in\nthe region? How have the poetic conventions of Indo-Islamic poetry\ncontinued to resonate? How did the interaction of Hindu and Muslim\nliterary, musical, visual, and religious cultures in the Mughal era help\nto generate the rich profusion of literature and music and cultural\ntolerance in this period?

An attempt will\nbe made to search for historical explanations of gendered identities\nand social anxieties in the context of various religious beliefs of\ncommunities living in the South Asian region. Following a series of\nhistorical events combined with theoretical approaches which had\nemerged after the departure of the colonial rulers, this course will\nexplore the following themes; (a) role of religion in construction of\npost colonial state and question of gender; (b) formation of state\npolicies and challenges of existing realities; (c) representation or\nabsence of women in post colonial political institutions. The central\nargument of the course is that, for historical understanding of a set of\nbeliefs and practices regarding gender relations and women’s status\nin any religious group, one needs to examine the historical context\nand socio-economic basis of that particular religion. By using the\nnotion of gender, class and historical feminist discourses as tools\nof analysis, this course intends to understand and explain existing\nperceptions, misperceptions, myths and realities regarding gender\nrelations and South Asian women’s situations in the colonial past\nwhich has shaped their post colonial present. It is crucial to understand\nIntersectionality of institutions of authority such as, patriarchal state\nand controlling religious beliefs that have shaped and continue to\nreshape “womanhood” in South Asia. In this context, it is necessary\nto examine how women have challenged, questioned and resisted\ntheir subservient status through confrontation, reinterpretation\nand negotiation in the world of academia and media. This course\nrevolves around a few major questions; How have the texts and re-\ninterpretations constructed Hindu, Muslim and Budhist femininity\nand masculinity? How have post colonial states and communities\napplied religious texts to control women’s body and sexuality? How\nhave the institutions of authority kept alive customs and traditions of\nveiling, segregation, family honor, sexual “purity” etc.? How have the\ncolonial and post colonial politics affected women’s mobility and space\nin public and private? How can historical re-reading of the religious\ntexts challenge the role of patriarchy and misogyny in the South Asian\npolitics, culture and education? It is expected that this course will\nenable students to (a) understand the main assumptions of gender\nand feminist theories and their importance in the study of history\nof religion; (b) acquire knowledge of the historical contexts, textual\nteachings and actual practices related to gender and women’s lives\nin South Asia; (c) analyze existing situations and current practices\nregarding gender issues in these regions; and (d) compare various\nscholarly inquiries, feminist discourses and conforming/confronting\nvoices of South Asian women emerging in the regional and global\ncontexts\nRELI GR9330 THEOR-TRANSMISSN/COMMUN FORMN. 4.00 points.\nIntended as the foundation course for graduate students in Religion\nwho are focusing on the Transmission zone of inquiry.

The Islamic world stretches\nacross a remarkable geographical expanse from modern Spain and\nSenegal in the west to the north of modern India in the east. Telling\none cohesive story out of many histories is therefore challenging, even\nif we had a full lifetime to devote to it.

Almost everywhere, so-\ncalled reform was undertaken, with the view of modernizing institutions\nand subjectivities along Western lines.

It has been designed to appeal to anthropologists, historians,\nand students interested in the Ancient Mediterranean and Middle\nEastern Studies. The course is divided into two parts. First, a social\nand political history of archaeology, emphasizing how the nature of\ncurrent theoretical and practical knowledge has been shaped and\ndeﬁned by previous research traditions and, second, how the current\npolitical situation in the region impinges upon archaeological practice.\nThemes include: the dominance of \"biblical archaeology\" and the\nimplications for Palestinian archaeology, Islamic archaeology, the\nimpact of European contact from the Crusades onwards, and the\ndevelopment of prehistory\nFall 2024: ANTH UN3007\nCourse\nNumber\nSection/Call\nNumber\nTimes/Location Instructor Points Enrollment\nANTH 3007 001/10397 T Th 11:40am - 12:55pm \n414 Pupin Laboratories\nBrian Boyd 3.00 13/35\nMDES UN3042 PALESTINIAN-ISRAELI POLIT/SOC. 4.00 points.\nThe History of the Jewish Enlightenment (Haskala) in 19th century\nEurope and the development of Zionism through the current peace\nprocess between the state of Israel and the Arab states and the\nPalestinian national movement.

What is the understanding of the\nreligious that seems to be the operative factor in these events? Is it\na singular concept of religion or are there different connotations of\nthis category? For instance, how do we understand religion when it\nbifurcates the women’s movement between Western ‘secular’ women\nand non-Western ‘Muslim’ women? Is it the same concept when we\nidentify ‘religion’ as the basis for the harmonious coexistence of Hindus\nand Muslims among certain non-elite communities in India? In this\ncourse, we ask if it even possible to understand, ‘religious’ events\nin the modern political world, without asking what other categories\nimplicitly inform our notion of the religious – such as, gender, caste,\nculture, race and historiography. We move beyond the strict dichotomy,\nof religion and secularism, as something given and unproblematic.\nDrawing from examples and events in modern South Asia as well as\nother postcolonial contexts, we attempt to respond to the concepts,\ncontradictions, and dilemmas that accompany the question of when\nand how the religious becomes the political in the modern world.\n Our weekly sessions will be devoted to reading texts from various\ndisciplines and analyzing how the main argument is formulated and\nhow that relates to a critique of the concept of religion in modern\nSouth Asia. Some weeks the scholarly texts will be supplemented by\nprimary texts/case studies that will serve as direct demonstration of\nthe problems that will be explored in the course. The engagement with\nsources from various disciplines will expose us to interdisciplinary\ncontent as well as diverse methods of critical analysis and\nargumentation. It will also help acquire the practice of identifying the\ncentral argument of the text, understand how the broad argument is\nactually formulated through smaller steps, and achieve the analytic\nskill to critically locate that single argument within a larger body of\nscholarship.\nEDUC BC3070 Growing Up Palestinian. 4.00 points.\nThis course explores broad questions about how sociopolitical\ncontexts shape the development of children and youth, by focusing\non the experiences of young Palestinians growing up across multiple\ngeographies.

How (and why) do young\npeople forge a sense of national identity across diverse territories, both\nwithin and outside of the borders of their historic homeland? How do\nsocio-political contexts shape young people’s rights, including the right\nto education? How do children and youth shape their environments?\nHow does a close examination of the Palestinian case challenge\nnormative ideas about childhood and youth, while also supporting us to\narticulate universal conditions that would support the well-being of all\nyoung humans?\nSpring 2025: EDUC BC3070\nCourse\nNumber\nSection/Call\nNumber\nTimes/Location Instructor Points Enrollment\nEDUC 3070 001/00793 W 2:10pm - 4:00pm \nLl001 Milstein Center\nThea Abu El-\nHaj\n4.00 22/22", "source": "pdfs/barnard 2024-2025.pdf"}

By the end of the 10th century CE the Islamic civilization\nhad appropriated many branches of the Greek knowledge, including\ncosmological philosophy, mathematics, astronomy, alchemy, music,\nand medicine among other disciplines. While some of these disciplines,\nsuch as cosmological philosophy, were heavily opposed by proponents\nof traditional sciences (Qur’anic exegesis, Hadith scholarship, Arabic\ngrammar, etc.), many of them became legitimate ﬁelds of knowledge\nfor Muslim intellectuals and scholars for many centuries until the dawn\nof modern science. With the advent of modern science, some of these\ndisciplines, such as mathematics and astronomy, were absorbed in\nthe new scientiﬁc paradigm as “exact sciences”; many others were\nrelegated to the domain of “occult sciences”. This course aims at\nsurveying the “Ancient sciences” in medieval Islam by studying several\nof these disciplines, both “exact” and “occult”.\nMDES UN3260 RETHINKING MIDDLE EAST POLITCS. 4.00 points.\nCC/GS/SEAS: Partial Fulﬁllment of Global Core Requirement \nThis course examines a set of questions that have shaped the study\nof the politics of the modern Middle East. It looks at the main ways\nthose questions have been answered, exploring debates both in\nWestern academic scholarship and among scholars and intellectuals\nin the region itself. For each question, the course offers new ways\nof thinking about the issue or ways of framing it in different terms.\nThe topics covered in the course include: the kinds of modern state\nthat emerged in the Middle East and the ways its forms of power and\nauthority were shaped; the birth of economic development as a way of\ndescribing the function and measuring the success of the state, and\nthe changing metrics of this success; the influence of oil on the politics\nof the region; the nature and role of Islamic political movements; the\ntransformation of the countryside and the city and the role of rural\npopulations and of urban protest in modern politics; and the politics\nof armed force and political violence in the region, and the ways in\nwhich this has been understood. The focus of the course will be on the\npolitics of the twentieth century, but many topics will be traced back\ninto developments that occurred in earlier periods, and several will be\nexplored up to the present. The course is divided into four parts, each\nending with a paper or exam in which participants are asked to analyze\nthe material covered.

Courses are given on its history, translation,\nmedia reproduction, Walt Disney’s appropriation, and, occasionally,\nnarratology. By the end of the 19th century, it was available in\ntranslation or abridgement in every written language. This course\nresituates its advent and vogue in speciﬁc cultural contexts that\nclosely relate to the rise of the bourgeoisie and the colonial enterprise.\nIt also explores popular and intellectual or critical responses in\nterms of the rise of literary theory and modes of literary production.\nIts massive presence gives way in time to pantomime, parody, and\npastiche, before engaging again the attention of prominent writers\nand theorists of ‘prose poetics’ and the fantastic. Its referential\npopular presence undergoes fluctuations to ﬁt media stereotypes\nand hegemonic regimes of thought. This course attempts to dislodge\noriginals from adaptations, highlight the nature of entry in terms\nof a commoditizing enterprise that reproduces the Arabian Nights\nas a ‘western text’, a point that in turn incites a counter search for\nmanuscripts, and ‘authentication’ processes.

Can infrastructure colonise, dispossess, and\ncause environmental ruin? We tend to think of infrastructure as useful\nobjects, but can we think of them as built ideologies? Historically,\ninfrastructural projects have been regarded as necessary preconditions\nof modern and efﬁcient states. So much so that malfunctioning sewers\nand perennial power cuts have come to invoke images of starved\nand underdeveloped countries. However, the question of whether\ninfrastructure itself fuels human and environmental underdevelopment\nis rarely asked. This course proposes a new way of thinking about\ninfrastructure. By studying the histories of various infrastructural\nprojects in the Middle East, we will critically assess their role as\nsites of political contestation rather than as “neutral technologies”.\nInfrastructure has been used by colonial states to exploit the natural\nresources of colonised territories and to control the populations they\nruled. At the same time, infrastructure is crucial in the formation of\nradical political identities and rich cultures and traditions of political\nstruggle. Yet, not all infrastructure is the same. By paying attention to\nthe material qualities and speciﬁc cultural and ideological history of\neach form of infrastructure we study, we will be able to understand how\ndifferent forms of infrastructure create and foreclose different political\npossibilities\nANTH UN3465 WOMEN, GENDER POL-MUSLIM WORLD. 3.00 points.\nCC/GS/SEAS: Partial Fulﬁllment of Global Core Requirement \nPractices like veiling, gendered forms of segregation, and the honor\ncode that are central to Western images of Muslim women are also\ncontested issues throughout the Muslim world. This course examines\ndebates about gender, sexuality, and morality and explores the interplay\nof political, social, and economic factors in shaping the lives of\nmen and women across the Muslim world, from the Middle East to\nEurope. The perspective will be primarily anthropological, although\nspecial attention will be paid to historical processes associated with\ncolonialism and nation-building that are crucial to understanding\npresent gender politics. We will focus on the sexual politics of everyday\nlife in speciﬁc locales and explore the extent to which these are shaped\nby these histories and the power of representations mobilized in a\nglobal world in the present and international political interventions.

From early moments of easy-going and\nconﬁdent cosmopolitan travellers, such as Ahmad Faris al-Shidyaq, to\nlater author, such as Tayeb Salih, mapping the existential fault lines\nbetween west and east. For this reason, and as well as being a modern\nphenomenon, the Arabic novel has also been a tool for translation,\nfor bridging gaps and exposing what al-Shidyaq—the man credited\nwith being the father of the modern Arabic novel, and himself a great\ntranslator—called ‘disjunction’. We will begin with his satirical, deeply\ninventive and erudite novel, published in 1855, Leg Over Leg. It is a\nbook with an insatiable appetite for deﬁnitions and comparisons,\nwith Words that had been lost or fell out of use (the author had an\nabiding interest in dictionaries that anticipates Jorge Louis Borges)\nand with locating and often subverting moments of connection and\ndisconnection. We will then follow along a trajectory to the present,\nwhere we will read, in English translation, novels written in Arabic,\nfrom Egypt, Syria, Sudan, Morocco and Palestine.

Students will become familiarized with important arguments\nthat have been advanced to explain climate change in its more\nrecent incarnations in the Middle East and Asia. How have different\ntrajectories of understanding climate change led to different kinds\nof political cultures and governing institutions? Have some qualities\nof the “environment” or “climate” remained the same throughout\nhistory and across the globe? What is the role of colonialism in modern\nunderstandings of climate change?

But Marx’s thought\nemerged from a highly speciﬁc intellectual context of European\nthought. Therefore, reading Marx must have a contextual, German\nand European side, and, equally, a global reception side. The purpose\nof this course will be to read Marx’s texts closely, and to follow the\ntrajectory of his ideas historically and therefore globally. In one sense,\nwe understand what ‘doing’ political theory means more clearly in\nstudying the struggles of Marx’s readers in addressing the question:\nhow can reading Marx illuminate the historical analysis of very different\nsocieties – societies which were not in Europe, societies which were\nnot based on a capitalist economy, societies that were not yet ‘modern’\nin their economy, politics and culture. A part of the course will be about\nthe Marxism of the ‘others’: American Black thinkers, and thinkers\nin China, India, Africa, the Middle East. To follow Marx’s thought\nhistorically is to read his thought globally. The course will be in three\nparts. The ﬁrst part will read some texts of Western social theory from\nwhich the central questions of Marx’s theoretical reflections were\ndrawn. Following a method of Indian philosophy in which philosophic\narguments are always read in relation to its purvapaksha (arguments\nin response to which the philosophical doctrine was conceived and\nelaborated), we shall start with questions ﬁrst introduced in Hobbes\n(individual) Locke (property and its relation to government) and Adam\nSmith (capitalism) in the British tradition, and Hegel (on history and\ncapitalism) and Feuerbach (religion and estrangement) in the German\ntradition. We shall explore the central arguments from these thinkers\nwhich Marx contends with – at times accepting and elaborating them,\nor modifying them, or directly questioning and rejecting them. In the\nsecond part of the course, we shall closely read some texts from Marx,\nbut also pair them with some of the major readings of their meanings\nfrom the Marxist tradition. Texts read will include the early journalistic\nwritings, Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts, Communist\nManifesto, the Grundrisse, political writings, Capital and Theories of\nSurplus Value, reflections on non-European history on the basis of his\nnotes on ‘pre-capitalist formations’ and ethnological manuscripts. In\nthe ﬁnal part of the course, we shall read major texts which show the\ndifferent kinds of readings Marx’s work received in different parts of\nthe world: Russian Communists, Asian Marxists from India and China,\nfrom the Middle east and Islamic societies, and from Africa. We shall\nend by readings of Marx from the West’s most intimate enemy: Black\nMarxists. Reading Marx historically is impossible without reading Marx\nglobally. This section will also, necessarily, engage in more abstract\nquestions about how we should read thought systems which originate\nin a particular thought ecology, but then circulates to entirely different\nsettings of reading and political action\nFall 2024: MDES GU4060\nCourse\nNumber\nSection/Call\nNumber\nTimes/Location Instructor Points Enrollment\nMDES 4060 001/14817 Th 2:10pm - 4:00pm \n208 Knox Hall\nSudipta\nKaviraj\n4.00 15/30\nJWST GU4145 Topics in Israeli Cinema. 3.00 points.\nIsrael has a unique and constantly-evolving national cinema,\nthe product of its diverse immigrant population, influences from\nneighboring nations, and dramatic national history.

Through the publication of\ntwo key texts in the late 1970s Robert Brenner's proposition that\ncapitalism had its origins in English agriculture came to dominate the\ntransition debate. More recently, however, there have been a number of\npublications that seek to challenge the Anglo-centric and Eurocentric\ntendencies of the entire transition debate. This course begins with the\nBrenner debates and then takes up revisions, critiques and challenges\nto that debate. Ultimately, the aim of the course is to more clearly\nunderstand the place of non-European polities and peoples in the\nhistory and development of capitalism\nJWST GU4156 An Introduction to World Zionist Thought. 4.00 points.\nIn this course, students will be exposed to a range of different ideas\nand movements that, together, constitute(d) “Zionism.” Although Israel\nis frequently in the news, the ideology that lies, in many ways, at the\nheart of Israeli politics and society is often represented in simplistic –\neven superﬁcial or inaccurate – terms. Far more than a mere example\nof “nationalism,” Zionism has variously been interwoven with struggles\nover land, labor, gender, religion, and identity in not only Palestine/\nIsrael, but also North Africa, East Africa, Southwest Asia, Central Asia,\nEurope, the Americas, and beyond. Throughout the semester, students\nwill read both primary and secondary sources in order to understand\nZionism in its myriad meanings. Part I of the course will explore\nsome of the basic tenets and debates of Zionism, with a focus on\nideas prominent in the early twentieth century, such as socialism and\nHebraism.

In the early days of the state a\nserious concern was raised: can Israel survive as a democracy facing\nthe difﬁculties resulting from mass immigration, meager resources,\ninternal divisions and external threats to its very existence? The\nIsraeli body-politic has proven cohesive enough to overcome tensions\nstemming from fragmented party politics, deep social and cultural\ncleavages, fundamental ideological schisms and an involvement in\nprotracted conflicts with neighboring states and the Palestinians.\nThose have become particularly urgent in the aftermath of the October\n7th attacks and the Israel-Hamas war of 2023-24. These achievements\nwere facilitated by the emergence of a pattern of politics, indeed, a\npolitical culture, that puts a strong emphasis on the pursuit of political\naccommodation. Such accommodation, however, has been put to the\ntest with the proposed judicial reform of 2023 and the ensuing mass\nsocial protests against it. Israel has done all these without loss of\npublic support for its central political and social institutions, but in\n2024, with the Israel-Hamas war and expanding social cleavages and\npolitical schisms, such accomplishments are at risk\nHIST GU4218 The Black Sea in History. 4 points.\n      We are used to thinking of history in national terms, or at least in\nreference to major civilizations (“Western civilization,”  “Near Eastern\ncivilization,” etc.). In  “real life,” however, interactions among people,\nlinguistic communities, and cultures frequently cut across political\ndivisions. Water – rivers, streams, seas – is often an invitation to\nsettlement, commerce, and conquest. This course offers a look\n(inspired in part by Fernand Braudel's Mediterranean) at a body of\nwater – the Black Sea – and the lands around it, in sweeping historical\nperspective. Focus is on those moments when the various civilizations\nand empires that originated and flourished around the Black Sea\nmet and intersected in friendship or in enmity. We will look at ancient\ncivilizations, Greek colonization, Byzantine-Slav interactions, the period\nof Ottoman dominance, Russian-Turkish rivalry, and decolonization and\nwars in the 19th and 20th centuries.

It works globally along two lines:\na theoretical one that accommodates conceptualizations of self-\nnarrative in relation to shifting categories of center and margin; and\na thematic one that selects a number of Arabic autobiographical\ntexts with strong thematic concerns that cut across multiple\ncultures. Although Europe sounds at times more conspicuous in\nearly 20th century autobiography, the Afro-Asian and Latin American\ntopographical and historical itinerary and context are no less\nso, especially in writings we associate with societal and cultural\ntransformations. More than historical accounts, these intellectual\nitineraries speak for the successes and failures of the secular ideology\nof the Arab nation-state. They convey the struggle of intellectuals--\nas self-styled leaders, for an ideal state on the ruins of the past.\nThe course studies a number of autobiographical works; memoirs\nand reminiscences that are meant to rationalize and reproduce a\nwriter’s experience. Probably self-censored, these serve nevertheless\nas trajectories for a secular journey rather than one from denial\nto afﬁrmation. Staunchly established in modernity and its nahdah\nparadigms, most of these writings are secular itineraries that rarely\nend in a search for faith. They are the journeys of a generation of Arab\nintellectuals who are facing many crises, but not the crisis of faith.\nThey provide another look at the making of the Arab intelligentsia-\nand probably the Afro-Asian and Latin American one, since the early\n20th century, and help us discern not only achievements on the level of\neducation and public service , but also the mounting discontent with\nfailures that have been wrapping the formation of the nation state.

These urban centers, scattered across Africa, Southeast Asia,\nand the Caribbean, often served as administrative, economic, and\ncultural hubs for the colonial administration. This seminar will explore\nthe profound impact of colonial cities as laboratories for experimenting\nwith new ideas in city planning, infrastructure, architecture, and civic\ngovernance. Once tried and tested in the colonies, these innovative\n“norms and forms” were often imported back to metropolitan France,\nwhere they helped shape various aspects of its society, culture, and\neconomy. The seminar is chronologically structured around six French\ncolonial cities: Cap-Français, Cairo, Algiers, Casablanca, Dakar, and\nHanoi. Each city is examined through the lens of a distinct set of\ncolonial policies and practices. Cap-Français is studied from the\nperspective of the universalist values of the French Enlightenment and\nthe double standard evident in the terror of the Atlantic slave trade.\nCairo, while colonized for only a brief period, ignited new passions\nfor the East and is viewed as a repository of exotic fantasies and a\nsite for infrastructural modernization. Algiers is studied through the\npolicy of assimilation and the destruction of Algerian religious identity.\nCasablanca is considered in relation to new planning practices and\ncolonial policies of association. Hanoi is examined through cultural\nand architectural forms of hybridity. Finally, Dakar is viewed through\ncolonial theories of acclimatization and hygiene policies. As we\ntraverse the diverse landscapes of these colonial cities, this seminar\ninvites participants to critically reﬂect on the enduring echoes of\nFrench colonialism, exploring how the urban experiments of the past\nreverberate in the present and inﬂuence our perceptions of global cities\nand their histories\nSpring 2025: ARCH GU4260\nCourse\nNumber\nSection/Call\nNumber\nTimes/Location Instructor Points Enrollment\nARCH 4260 001/00847 T 4:10pm - 6:00pm \n502 Diana Center\nRalph Ghoche 4.00-8.00 9/16\nMDES GU4260 RETHINKING MIDDLE EAST POLITCS. 4.00 points.\nThis course examines a set of questions that have shaped the study\nof the politics of the modern Middle East. It looks at the main ways\nthose questions have been answered, exploring debates both in\nWestern academic scholarship and among scholars and intellectuals\nin the region itself. For each question, the course offers new ways\nof thinking about the issue or ways of framing it in different terms.\nThe topics covered in the course include: the kinds of modern state\nthat emerged in the Middle East and the ways its forms of power and\nauthority were shaped; the birth of economic development as a way of\ndescribing the function and measuring the success of the state, and\nthe changing metrics of this success; the influence of oil on the politics\nof the region; the nature and role of Islamic political movements; the\ntransformation of the countryside and the city and the role of rural\npopulations and of urban protest in modern politics; and the politics\nof armed force and political violence in the region, and the ways in\nwhich this has been understood.

Survivors of these\ncrimes have sought justice and reparations, while also struggling to\nkeep alive the memory of all that was lost. Words and images are\nemployed in this struggle. The literary, performing, and visual arts\nplay key roles in resisting the destruction of memory. Genocide is a\ncrime whose aim is not just the annihilation of biological individuals\nbut of social groups and their cultural heritage. Words (in the form of\npoetry, memoir, drama, ﬁction) and images (in the form of photography,\nﬁlm, painting) are used to combat the forgetting, the denial, and the\ndistorting of genocidal crimes. This course will explore the ways\nthese forms of memory resilience work in the case of the Armenian\nGenocide. While often under-appreciated, Armenians began a process\nof reflection upon and resistance against their cultural loss in the\ndecades after 1915. Yet it took another generation for artists and\nwriters to foreground this resistance in their creative output. In parallel\nto the Jewish response to the Holocaust, the 1960’s and 70’s saw the\nawakening of a greater Armenian public response to the genocide.\nAlong with memorialization and demands for justice, a heightened\ncritical reflection on the meaning of loss took place. Historical\nstudies of the genocide multiplied adding to our understanding of\nthe nature and causes of the violence. Alongside such scholarship\nthe broader discipline of memory studies has immeasurable added\nto our understanding of 1915.

Ever since the 19th century Jewish Enlightenment\n(Haskalah), Hebrew literature has played a major role in the processes\nof permutation and transition within Jewish society, articulating new\nmodes of thinking on matters such as body, identity, sexuality and\nlanguage. In both its themes and aesthetics, Hebrew literature not only\nreflected these processes, but in fact created and shaped the public\nsphere within which these new ideas emerged. Identifying literature as\nan institution of the modern, intertwined with the rise of nationalism,\nthis course examines the coincidence, as well as the discrepancy,\nbetween modernist poetics and the nationalist imagination.

The\nclass is structured around key theoretical readings from a range of\nacademic disciplines ranging from art history and anthropology to\ncomparative literature and religion. The course begins by placing\nthe controversies surrounding the visual depiction of Muhammad in\nhistorical perspective (Gruber). This is followed by an examination\nof modern portrayals of Muslims in ﬁlm that highlights both the\nviliﬁcation of the “other” (Shaheen) and the persistence of colonial\ndiscourses centered on the “native informant” (Mamdani). Particular\nemphasis is given to recent pop cultural works that challenge these\nsimplistic discourses of Islam. The second half of the course revisits\nMuhammad, employing an anthropological framework (Asad) to\nunderstand the controversies surrounding Salman Rushdie’s Satanic\nVerses. The obsession with a gendered depiction of Islam is then\nexamined through an anthropological framework that sheds light on\nthe problems of salvation narratives (Abu Lughod). The course ends\nwith a look at the unique history of Islam in America, particularly the\ntension between immigrant and African-American communities\nMDES GU4627 Signiﬁcant Others. 4.00 points.\nWhat is the relationship between homoeroticism and homosociality?\nHow does this relationship form conceptions of gender and sexuality\nin ways that might be historically unfamiliar and culturally or regionally\nspeciﬁc? We pursue these questions through the lens of friendship and\nits relationship to ideas and expressions of desire, love, and loyalty in\npre-modern times. We begin by considering the intellectual basis of\nthe modern idea of friendship as a private, personal relationship, and\ntrace it back to earlier times when it was often a public relationship\nof social and political signiﬁcance. Some of these relationships\nwere between social equals, while many were unequal forms (like\npatronage) that could bridge social, political or parochial differences.\nThinking through the relationships and possible distinctions between\nerotic love, romantic love and amity (love between friends), we will\ndraw on scholarly works from a variety of disciplinary perspectives,\nparticularly philosophy, sociology, political theory, literature, history,\nand art history. We will attend to friendship’s work in constituting,\nmaintaining and challenging various social and political orders in a\nvariety of Asian contexts (West, Central, South and East Asian), with\ncomparative reference to scholarship on European and East Asian\ncontexts.

For over a\nmillennium, from the seventh through even the twenty-ﬁrst century,\nand spanning a broad geographical spectrum from the Nile to Oxus,\ndifferent forms and praxis of occult scientiﬁc knowledge marked\nintellectual and political endeavors, everyday lives and customs, and\nfaith-based matters of individuals constituting the so-called Islamicate\nworld. However, despite the impressive array of textual, material, and\nvisual sources coming down to us from the Muslim past, the topic has\nbeen severely marginalized under the post-Enlightenment deﬁnitions\nof scientiﬁc knowledge, which also shaped how the history of sciences\nin the Islamicate world was written in the last century. One of this\nseminar’s main objectives is to rehabilitate such biased perspectives\nthrough a grand tour of occult knowledge and practice appealed in the\npre-modern Muslim world. Over the semester, by relying on a set of\nsecondary studies and translated primary sources, we will revisit the\nquestion of the marginalization of Islamicate occult sciences, explore\nthe actors’ deﬁnitions and discussions about the epistemic value of\nthese sciences, trace their social and political implications in everyday\nlife and imperial politics, and examine the key textual, technical, and\nmaterial aspects of the occult tradition.

Following\nthe Arab Spring and subsequent upheaval in Egypt, Syria, Iraq, Yemen,\nLibya and more, the region is in a state of historic flux. The Sunni-\nShia rivalry, especially between Saudi Arabia and Iran, growing Iranian-\nIsraeli conflict, population explosion, poverty and authoritarian control,\nRussian ascendance and US retrenchment, are the primary regional\ndrivers today. Together, these factors have transformed the Middle\nEastern landscape, with great consequence for the national security\nof the countries of the region and their foreign relations. The primary\nsource of the worlds energy resources, the Middle East remains the\nlocus of the terror-WMD-fundamentalist nexus, which continues to\npose a signiﬁcant threat to both regional and international security.\nThe course surveys the national security challenges facing the regions\nprimary players (Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan,\nIsrael, the Palestinians and Turkey,) and how the convolutions of\nrecent years have affected them. Unlike many Middle East courses,\nwhich focus on US policy in the region, the course concentrates on\nthe regional players perceptions of the threats and opportunities they\nface and the strategies they have adopted to deal with them.

And what ideologies informed the way these\nmigrants were received in a new country (e.g. nativism, nationalism,\nOrientalism, philhellenism)?

Some of the topics covered will be:\nthe emergence of new media (such as photography or cinema),\nthe creation of \"national\" cultures, experiments in Pan-Africanism,\ndiasporic consciousness, and the rise of curators as international\nculture-brokers. The course will examine the enthusiastic embrace\nby African artists of the biennial platform as a site for the production\nof contemporary art. What differential impact has French vs. British\ncolonialism left on the arts? How are contemporary artists responding\nto calls for restitution on African cultural heritage?\nAHIS UN3610 Visualizing Japanese Buddhism. 4 points.\nIt has long been recognized that Buddhism is a religion whose tenets\nare constantly being absorbed, reinterpreted, and disseminated through\nimages. While artworks exist as compliments to doctrinal thought,\nthey are also integral components to ritual and belief, and can even\nunderpin and inspire new forms of religious thought. This course\nprovides a multi-disciplinary approach to the study of Buddhist art\nin Japan. Each week, we will focus on one group of related images,\nstudying and analyzing their basic design or composition and material.\nThen, we will think about their original use, how they served speciﬁc\nritual functions, or how they promoted certain Buddhist teachings.\nThemes to be considered include the development of Japanese\nBuddhist art in relation to the broader East Asian context and to\nindigenous Japanese religions (Shinto), the role of art and architecture\nin promulgating larger belief systems, women as Buddhist practitioners\nand as commissioners of religious art projects, and the deiﬁcation of\nhistorical ﬁgures. By the end of this course, students will acquire an\nunderstanding of the multiple ways people in the Japanese archipelago\ninterpreted Buddhist art over time, and will learn to evaluate and\nanalyze religious artworks within speciﬁc ideological frameworks.\nAHIS UN3611 Korean Art in the Age of Global Encounters. 4 points.\nThis seminar explores the artistic developments in Korea with a focus\non its encounter with the arts of China, Japan, and Europe from the\nﬁfteenth century to the present.

The class sections\nare arranged in chronological order. We will investigate the distinct\nformats of portable paintings from the 2nd to 18th centuries (including\nfunerary banners, handscrolls, hanging scrolls, albums, screens, and\nfans) and the representations of paintings of various formats in tombs\nand other architectural-pictorial contexts. We will probe into the new\nnotions and thoughts presented by the new pictorial formats, and\nexamine how they have been conventionalized and re-developed by\nlater works. The goal is to foreground frame, scale, surface and ground,\nas carriers as well as boundaries, of image in the discussions of image,\nand to see painting as the happenings that were schematized and\nrealized by these external, yet also intrinsic, agents. Students will have\nthe chance to peruse the artworks in museum visits, and are expected\nto do presentations that address the selected pictures with format\ninsights.

Emphasis will be laid on the role of\nreligion in Armenian self-identiﬁcation. Relevant works from other\ncultures in the Museum’s encyclopedic collections will be used for\ncomparative study. Students will do a paper on an Armenian work\nselected from the exhibition and present an aspect of their research\nin class.

With the arrival of the ﬁrst Jewish\nimmigrants in New York in the mid-1600s until today, Jewish music in\nthe City has oscillated between preserving traditions and introducing\ninnovative ideas. This course explores the variety of ways people\nhave used music to describe, inscribe, symbolize, and editorialize\ntheir Jewish experience. Along these lines, it draws upon genres of art\nmusic, popular music, and non-Western traditions, as well as practices\nthat synthesize various styles and genres, from hazzanut to hiphop.\nDiverse musical experiences will serve as a window to address wider\nquestions of identity, memory, and dislocation. We will also experience\nthe Jewish soundscape of New York’s dynamic and eclectic music\nculture by visiting various venues and meeting key players in today’s\nmusic scene, and thus engage in the ongoing dialogues that deﬁne\nJewishness in New York. A basic familiarity with Judaism and Jewish\nculture is helpful for this course, but it is by no means required.

Translations from Hebrew and Yiddish will be\nprovided, and musical analysis will be well explained\nJWST UN2155 Music, Sound, and Antisemitism. 3.00 points.\nFrom the Middle Ages to the present, individuals involved in making\nand writing about music, have engaged in behaviors, creations, and\ndiscourses steeped in hatred of Jews. This course examines the\nvarious ways in which these individuals have used music to perform\nand inscribe, symbolize, describe, and editorialize antisemitism. In so\ndoing, it focuses on musicking—a term that encompasses all musical\nactivity from composing to performing to listening—in the realms\nof art music, popular music, and non-Western traditions, as well as\nof genres that synthesize different styles. It also draws on sound,\nincluding language and speech as well as writings such as Wagner’s\nJudenthum in der Musik (1848−50/69) and Carl Engel’s The Music of\nthe Most Ancient Nations (1864). All of these will serve as a window\nthrough which to address the types of Jew-hatred that have become\nknown since the mid-nineteenth century as antisemitism—religious,\nnational and ethnic, political, populist, economic, and institutional\n—as well as hate speech or “hate talk” and the Jewish responses to\nit. A basic familiarity with music is helpful for this course, but it is\nnot required as long as there is an openness to listening to music\nand a commitment to basic aural analysis.

In a sequence of core courses, a chemistry or\nbiochemistry major gains familiarity with the basic areas of the ﬁeld:\ninorganic, organic, physical, analytical, and biological chemistry. In\naddition, she acquires sufﬁcient skill in laboratory work that she is\nprepared for research.\nThe laboratories of the department are modern and well-equipped for\nboth coursework and independent projects. Students may undertake\nresearch projects under the guidance of members of the department\nduring the academic year or the summer. Opportunities are also\navailable for research with Columbia faculty as well as staff members\nof the many medical schools and research institutions in New York\nCity.\nAP Credit\nStudents with scores of 4 or 5 on the Chemistry AP test or a 5, 6 or 7 on\nthe IB chemistry exam can receive 3 credits of unspeciﬁed chemistry\ncredit.  Students may not \"place out\" of CHEM BC2001 unless they\nhave taken the equivalent course(s) in college.\nPre-Medical Program\nNon majors who are interested in the pre-health professions should\nwork with the pre-health adviser to determine the best selection of\nchemistry courses for their goals. information about the topics covered\nin each chemistry course is available through the prehealth professions\nofﬁce to facilitate student choice.\nChair: Marisa Buzzeo (Professor)\nAssistant Chair: Rachel Narehood Austin (Professor)\nProfessors: Rachel Narehood Austin, Marisa Buzzeo, Dina Merrer,\nChristian Rojas\nAssociate Professors: Michael Campbell, Andrew Crowther, Christina\nVizcarra\nAssistant Professors: Rebecca Donegan\nSenior Lecturer: Meenakshi Rao, Jean Vadakkan\nLecturer: Angela Paoletta\nTerm Assistant Professor: Romina Mancusso\nSenior Laboratory Associate: SuQing Liu\nLaboratory Instructional Support Specialists: Craig Allen, Grace Lee,\nMarina Orman\nGeneral Chemistry Laboratory Director: Angela Paoletta\nOrganic Chemistry Laboratory Director: Meenakshi Rao\nCore Facilities and Instrument Manager: Kaitlyn Dutton\nStaff\nDepartment Assistants: Laura Hendrickson, Rebecca Perrington\nRequirements for the Major\n Two majors are offered by the department: Chemistry and\n Biochemistry. There is also a special track within chemistry\n for students  who are interested in pursuing graduate study in\n chemical engineering \nA student interested in chemistry or biochemistry should consult any\nmember of the department during her ﬁrst year. In the ﬁrst year they\nshould take CHEM BC2001 GENERAL CHEMISTRY I, CHEM BC3328\nINTRO ORGANIC CHEMISTRY-LAB, and CHEM BC3230 ORGANIC\nCHEMISTRY I-LEC and start or continue the study of calculus.\nIn addition to required coursework, research experience is strongly\nrecommended and may begin as early as the sophomore year.\nInterested students should consult with individual faculty members\nabout research opportunities.", "source": "pdfs/barnard 2024-2025.pdf"}

The study of the languages enables access to a wide range\nof challenging and influential ancient texts, artifacts, and ideas and\nalso makes the grammar, syntax, and vocabulary of English and\nother modern languages more comprehensible. The study of these\ntexts, in turn, develops analytical and critical thinking about both\nthe past and the present, the ability to assess many different kinds\nof fragmentary evidence, as well as skills in writing, close reading\nand oral presentation, cultural awareness, and literary sensibility.\nClose cooperation between Barnard and Columbia enables ancient\nstudies students to plan and implement an integrated, cohesive\ninterdisciplinary study of the ancient world, including language,\nliterature, mythology, history, religion, philosophy, law, political theory,\ncomparative literature, medieval studies, gender studies, art history,\nand material culture. The texts and monuments of the Greco-Roman\nworld served as the basis of Western education until the twentieth-\ncentury and retain a core position in modern humanities and social\nthought that is currently expanding beyond the West. Exploring,\nanalyzing, and assessing this legacy is the central goal of the program.\nPrograms of Study\nThe department offers two majors. The majors in Classics (Greek, Latin,\nor Classics) center on work in the original languages, whereas the\nmajor in Ancient Studies has an interdisciplinary focus. All members\nof the department are available for major advising and students ideally\nchoose an adviser who can help them develop their required senior\nessay.\nThe Major in Classics (Greek), Classics (Latin), or\nClassics (Latin and Greek)\nClassics majors develop a knowledge of Greek and Latin as a gateway\nto the study of the literature, history, and culture of Greece and Rome.\nStudents can start Greek and Latin at Barnard or build on skills\nacquired in high school. Second-year courses introduce students\nto original texts in Greek or Latin by authors such as Homer, Plato,\nHerodotus, or the Greek orators or Vergil, Ovid, Horace, Cicero, Caesar,\nLivy, or Sallust. A range of advanced courses in Greek or Latin focus on\nprose or poetic texts drawn from ancient epic, lyric poetry, philosophy,\ndrama, history, rhetoric, or the novel and introduce critical approaches\nand literary and historical scholarship. Students are encouraged to take\nmore courses in ancient history and classical literature and civilization\nthan the two required for the major. Students planning to go on to\ngraduate work in Classics and related ﬁelds are advised to undertake\nat least three years in both languages as well as to begin acquiring the\nability to read scholarship in French, German, or Italian. Study abroad\nfor one semester in either Greece or Rome is common and encouraged.\nThe Major in Ancient Studies\nAll students in the department are encouraged to take courses in\nhistory and classical civilization that require no knowledge of the\nlanguages. Students in the more fully interdisciplinary Ancient Studies\nmajor combine study of at least one ancient language with a range\nof courses in various departments focusing on language, literature,\nmythology, history, religion, philosophy, political theory, law, ﬁlm,\ncomparative literature, medieval studies, gender studies, art history\nand material culture. Each student develops a concentration in one\ngeographical area or period but is encouraged to focus on a set of\nrelated issues and questions. Ancient Studies students will encounter\nmany disciplinary approaches and investigate Greek and Roman and\nrelated ancient cultures in Egypt and the Near East and their influences\non later Western (and to the degree possible, non-Western) culture.\nFrom this perspective, the major can complement work in other liberal\narts majors. Study abroad for one semester in either Greece, Rome,\nEgypt, or the Near East is common and encouraged.\nThe MInor in Classics\nThe Minor in Ancient Studies\nThe minor in Ancient Studies requires ﬁve courses that focus on\nAncient Mediterranean or Ancient Near Eastern civilizations. At least\none history course is required. Four other courses will compliment\nthat course to provide an interdisciplinary understanding of a speciﬁc\nregion and/or time period.\nThe Minor in Modern Greek\nStudent Learning Objectives\nClassics\nStudents successfully completing a major in Classics should be able to\nattain the following objectives:\n• Translate a range of Greek or Latin texts at a moderately advanced\nlevel and demonstrate an understanding of the grammar and\nsyntax of ancient languages.\n• Read, analyze, and write about ancient texts persuasively and\nlocate texts in their historical and cultural contexts.", "source": "pdfs/barnard 2024-2025.pdf"}

Students of the department have\nproduced Antigone, Medea, Alcestis, Persians, Eumenides, Cyclops,\nElectra, Clouds, Trojan Women, Rudens, Helen, Trachiniae, Bacchae,\nHippolytus, Heracles, Birds, and Persa, which have provided an exciting\nand different learning experience for the participants.\nClassics in New York\nEvery effort is made to introduce students to considerable resources\nfor the study and influence of the Classics in New York City, including\nplays, ﬁlms, and museum and gallery visits.\nCareers Undertaken by Classics and\nAncient Studies Majors\nOur majors graduate well prepared for graduate careers in Classics and\nrelated academic ﬁelds such as history, philosophy, archaeology, art\nhistory or comparative literature. They also enter successful careers in\nsecondary school teaching, museum work and arts administration, as\nwell as law, medicine and biological sciences, business, politics, public\nservice in both the government and non-proﬁt sectors, journalism and\ncreative writing, publishing, library science, and the arts (especially\ntheater, ﬁlm, and dance).\nStudy Abroad\nThe following three programs are pre-approved, but students may\ndiscuss other options with their advisers.\nICCS in Rome\nBarnard College participates in the program of the Intercollegiate\nCenter for Classical Studies in Rome. Majors in Classics or Ancient\nStudies are eligible to apply for admission to the program of the Rome\nCenter for one semester, preferably in the junior year. Courses taken at\nthe Rome Center may be used in the major and, in some cases, may\nbe used to satisfy distribution requirements. The program provides\nundergraduate students with an opportunity to study ancient history\nand archaeology in Rome, Greek and Latin literature, and ancient and\nrenaissance art. Students planning to apply to the ICCS should plan\nto take Roman history before applying and preference is given to\nthose with two or more years of Latin and Greek. Applications for the\nspring term are due in mid-October and for the fall term in mid-March.\nBecause of Sicily’s ancient connections to Greece, the program focuses\nmore on the Hellenic culture of Magna Graeca and Sicily’s place as a\ncultural crossroads in the ancient Mediterranean.\nICCS in Sicily\nThe focus of ICCS Sicily, as in the original program in Rome, will be on\nclassical languages as well as on local manifestations of history and\ncivilization in the ancient Mediterranean world. Based at the University\nof Catania, in a city with a rich ancient, medieval and Baroque history,\nthis program offers extensive local academic resources and close\nproximity to both the mainland and other towns on the island.\nCYA: College Year In Athens\nThe College Year in Athens (CYA) program offers either one semester or\na full year of courses in ancient and modern Greek languages, history,\nart, and archaeology, as well as advanced Latin and courses in post-\nclassical and modern Greek culture, politics, and history. Almost 200\ncolleges participate in the CYA. Applications for the spring term must\nbe received by mid-October and by mid-May for the fall term.\nSummer Study\nStudents interested in summer programs in archaeology should\nconsult the website of the American Institute for Archaeology (AIA)\nunder ﬁeldwork.\nThe CUNY Greek and Latin Workshops in midtown Manhattan offer\nspecial intensive summer language programs in Greek and Latin. Other\ninstitutions including Columbia offer summer language courses.

The ﬁrst part of the course will\nestablish context, before laying out a narrative framework; the second\npart of the course will explore a series of themes, especially the\ntension between military conquest, political negotiation, and social\ninteractions. Overall, the course will serve as an exercise in historical\nmethodology (with particular attention to ancient sources and to\ninterpretation), an introduction to the geography and the history of the\nancient world (classical and near-eastern), and the exploration of a\ncomplex testcase located at the contact point between several worlds,\nand at a watershed of world history\nCLLT UN3125 Book Histories and the Classics. 3 points.\nPrerequisites: HUMA CC1001 or HUMA GS1001COCI CC1101\nThis seminar will introduce students of classical literature to the\nhistory of the Western book, and to the relationship between book\nhistory and the transmission and reception history of the literature of\nancient Greece and Rome.  Students will also learn how to make use of\nrare books materials including manuscripts and early printed books......\nCLLT V3132 Classical Myth. 3 points.\nBC: Fulﬁllment of General Education Requirement: Literature (LIT). \nSurvey of major myths from the ancient Near East to the advent of\nChristianity, with emphasis upon the content and treatment of myths\nin classical authors (Homer, Hesiod, Aeschylus, Euripides, Sophocles,\nVergil, Livy, Ovid).\nCLCV BC3212 TOPICS IN ANCIENT DRAMA. 0.00-3.00 points.\nThis course is designed as an accompaniment to the Greek or Latin\nplay that is put on by the Barnard and Columbia Ancient Drama Group\neach year, though it is open to any student interested in the aesthetics\nand politics of theater and drama.

The course will examine major\ncontroversies concerning the form and meaning of the poem, with\nspecial emphasis on the poetic tension created by the narrator’s\nneurotic personality. The narration of the 49 BCE civil war between\nCaesar and Pompey is for Lucan the pretext for an original and\nintensely personal reflection on themes such as political oppression,\nthe role of the individual in society, nihilism, self-destructiveness,\nmental disorder, and artistic creation. The poem will be analyzed\nfrom various critical perspectives that include rhetoric, intertextuality,\ndeconstruction, reception theory, and psychoanalysis; no previous\nknowledge of any of these methodologies is required. Although an\nacceptable knowledge of Latin (intermediate or above) is assumed, the\nprimary focus of this course is literary and sociological interpretation\nrather than linguistic competence. In addition to the Latin reading\nassignments, the poem will also be read entirely in English translation,\nallowing students to comprehend the whole while they engage with\nparticular sections in the original language.

In particular,\nthey describe mental processes as computational operations\non internal representations.  For instance, perception is seen as\na representation of the external world that results from sensory\nstimulation; learning is analyzed as the addition of new representations\nthrough interactions with the environment; reasoning is treated as\nthe addition of new representations through operations on existing\nrepresentations.\nCognitive Science is an interdisciplinary ﬁeld: it draws on tools and\nideas from psychology, neuroscience, linguistics, economics, computer\nscience, and philosophy, with afﬁliated faculty in each of these\ndisciplines. Psychologists study the computational operations that we\nuse to solve speciﬁc tasks; neuroscientists study the implementation\nof those operations in the brain; linguists study the representations\ninvolved in communication; economists study the representations\ninvolved in decisions involving uncertainty and reward; computer\nscientists consider how the processes involved in human cognition\nﬁt into a more general theory of computations and a larger space of\ntasks; and philosophers ask fundamental questions about the nature of\nrepresentation and computation.\nStudent Learning Outcomes\nCognitive Science majors will gain fluency in computational methods; a\ncapacity for rigorous and careful thought; a broad understanding of the\nafﬁliated disciplines; and a deep understanding of cognition.\nBarnard Director: Professor Ann Senghas \nColumbia Director: Professor Brendan Fleig-Goldstein\nSteering Committee: \nDima Amso (Psychology, Columbia) \nBrendan Fleig-Goldstein (Philosophy, Columbia) \nJohn McWhorter (Linguistics, Columbia) \nJohn Morrison (Philosophy, Barnard) \nChristopher A.B.

The major requirements\nare designed to provide breadth in the afﬁliated disciplines and depth in\nthe student’s chosen area of specialization.\nA major in Cognitive Science consists of seven required courses\nand four electives in a chosen area of specialization culminating in\nthe senior capstone. The minimum number of courses is 13 and the\nminimum number of points is 39.\nMajor Requirements:\n1. Required courses (7 classes)\n• COGS UN1001 Introduction to Cognitive Science Introduction to\nCognitive Science\n• One cognition-focused course in each of four areas: psychology,\nneuroscience, philosophy, and linguistics. \nCourses must be chosen from the approved list in each area; please\nsee the approved lists below.\n• Two courses in a ﬁfth area: mathematical and computational\nmethods. \nCourses must be chosen from the approved list and not be redundant;\nplease see the approved lists below.\n2. Area of Specialization and Electives (four classes)\nStudents must choose an area of specialization and four electives to\nbuild expertise in that area.\n• Sample specializations: aesthetics, cognitive development,\ncognitive linguistics, cognitive neuroscience, cognitive psychology,\nconsciousness, decision science, human-computer interaction,\nintelligence, learning, memory, natural language processing,\nneuroeconomics, perception, and social cognition. Please see\nbelow for lists of possible electives for these specializations.\n• The choice of specialization is flexible; the sample specializations\nare just examples. This is an opportunity for students to be\ncreative; a student who has ideas about a new specialization\nthat they would like to pursue may do so with the approval of the\nprogram director.\n• There must be at least one faculty member afﬁliated with the\nprogram who has expertise in the student’s chosen area so that\nthey can ensure that the student’s electives will provide sufﬁcient\npreparation for the senior project.\n3. Senior Capstone\nStudents may fulﬁll the Senior Capstone requirement in two ways:\nwith a year-long senior project, or by taking two additional advanced\ncourses.\n• The senior project is a year-long project in a student’s area of\nspecialization under the supervision of a chosen advisor. The\nproject could be an experiment or a paper.  Please note that a\nstudent who wishes to do a senior project is responsible for ﬁnding\nan advisor for the project, though the program director may be able\nto suggest faculty members whom the student might contact.\n• Students who do senior projects must register for both\nCOGS UN3903 Senior Project (3 points) and COGS UN3901\nSenior Project Seminar (1 point) in the fall and COGS UN3904\nSenior Project (3 points) and COGS UN3902 Senior Project\nSeminar (1 point) in the spring (8 points total).  \n• The Senior Project Seminar is an opportunity for students to\npresent their projects to each other.\n• While a year-long project is recommended, students may also\nsatisfy the senior capstone requirement by taking two advanced\ncourses, at least one of which must include a signiﬁcant paper\nor project. The courses must be chosen in consultation with the\nprogram director and must be related to the student’s area of\nspecialization. Both courses should be at the 3000-level or above.\nThe area of specialization, electives, and capstone must form a\ncoherent course of study and must be approved by the program\ndirector.\nPlease note:\n• Courses taken pass/fail may not count towards Cognitive Science\nmajor requirements.\n• While some courses listed under the sample specializations\nare also on the lists of courses approved to count for area\nrequirements, no course may be double counted: if a student is\ncounting a course for an area requirement, then that course may\nnot be counted as an elective.\nCourses approved to count in each area:\nPsychology\nPSYC BC2107 PSYCHOLOGY OF LEARNING - LEC\nPSYC BC2110 PERCEPTION-LECTURE\nPSYC BC2115 COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY - LEC\nPSYC BC2129 DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY-LEC\nPSYC UN2210 COGNITION: BASIC PROCESSES\nPSYC UN2220 COGNITION: MEMORY AND STRESS\nPSYC UN2270 Perception and Cognition in Social Life\nPSYC UN2280 Developmental Psychology\nPSYC UN2430 COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE\nPSYC BC3394 METACOGNITION\nPlease note that PSYC UN2430 Cognitive Neuroscience may be used to\nfulﬁll either the Neuroscience requirement or the Psychology requirement,\nbut not both. \nNeuroscience\nNSBV BC1001 INTRODUCTION TO NEUROSCIENCE\nNSBV BC2008 ADAPTIVE OR ARRESTED\nDEVELOPMENT OF THE ADOLESCENT\nBRAIN\nPSYC UN2430 COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE\nPSYC UN2435 Social Neuroscience\nPSYC UN2450 BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE\nPSYC UN2481 Developmental Cognitive Neuroscience\nNSBV BC3381 Visual Neuroscience: From the Eyeball\nto the Mind's Eye\nPlease note that PSYC UN2430 Cognitive Neuroscience may be used to\nfulﬁll either the Neuroscience requirement or the Psychology requirement,\nbut not both. ", "source": "pdfs/barnard 2024-2025.pdf"}

And\nin addition to describing what is known about how the underlying\nmechanisms work (something that is understood in more detail in\nsensory contexts than in the case of value-based decision making),\nthe course will consider the extent to which such mechanisms --- while\nsuboptimal from a normative standpoint that treats perfect knowledge\nof one's situation as costless and automatic --- might actually represent\nefﬁcient uses of the limited information and bounded information-\nprocessing resources available to actual people (or other organisms).\nThus the course will consider both ways in which the realism of\neconomic analysis may be improved by taking into account cognitive\nprocesses, and ways in which understanding of cognitive processes\nmight be advanced by considering the economic problem of efﬁcient\nuse of limited (cognitive) resources\nPHIL UN1401 INTRODUCTION TO LOGIC. 3.00 points.\nExplicit criteria for recognizing valid and fallacious arguments, together\nwith various methods for schematizing discourse for the purpose of\nlogical analysis.

Humans deal\nsuccessfully with the world in a way that no machine can (for now),\nyet we routinely behave in ways that seem grossly inconsistent with\nnormative canons of rational inference and rational choice. This\ncourse will seek to resolve the paradox by exploring the idea that\nwhile we make many mistakes, these mistakes are not haphazard;\ninstead, they reflect a brain that is highly efﬁcient at inference and\ndecision making within the information, time, and energy constraints\nimposed by the ﬁnite resources available to it. In other words, our\nbrains may be “resource-rational” even if they fail to conform to ideal\ncanons of rationality. We will explore this idea by considering the\nstructure of errors, biases and illusions in the context of perceptual\njudgments, more abstract cognitive judgments (perceptions of\nnumerical magnitudes or probabilities), and economic decisions;\nwe will see that there are many analogies between the kinds of\ncharacteristic errors that people make in all of these contexts.\nA potential explanatory framework, which can be applied across\ncontexts, considers what optimal decisions should be like in the\ncase of a decision unit that has only imprecise information about its\nsituation. Hence statistical modeling and statistical inference are key\nelements in the computational models of human decision making that\nwe wish to discuss\nHuman-Computer Interaction\nPSYC UN3270 COMPUT APPROACHES-HUMAN VISION. 3.00 points.\nThis course will be offered in Fall 2016.\nPrerequisites: some background in psychology and/or neurophysiology\n(e.g., PSYC W1001, PSYC W1010, PSYC W2230, PSYC W2450; BIOL W3004\nor BIOL W3005) is desirable.

In many\ncases, this provides a good approximation to the types of behavior\nthat economists are interested in. However, over the past 30 years,\nexperimental and behavioral economists have documented ways in\nwhich the standard model is not just wrong, but is wrong in ways that\nare important for economic outcomes. Understanding these behaviors,\nand their implications, is one of the most exciting areas of current\neconomic inquiry. The aim of this course is to provide a grounding\nin the main areas of study within behavioral economics, including\ntemptation and self control, fairness and reciprocity, reference\ndependence, bounded rationality and choice under risk and uncertainty.\nFor each area we will study three things: 1. The evidence that indicates\nthat the standard economic model is missing some important behavior\n2. The models that have been developed to capture these behaviors\n3. Applications of these models to (for example) ﬁnance, labor and\ndevelopment economics As well as the standard lectures, homework\nassignments, exams and so on, you will be asked to participate in\neconomic experiments, the data from which will be used to illustrate\nsome of the principals in the course.

Observed behavior often seems difﬁcult to\nreconcile with a strong form of this theory, even if incentives clearly\nhave some influence on behavior; and the course will discuss empirical\nevidence (both from laboratory experiments and observations in\nthe ﬁeld) for some well-established anomalies. But beyond simply\ncataloguing anomalies for the standard theory, the course will consider\nthe extent to which departures from a strong version of rational\nchoice theory can be understood as reflecting cognitive processes\nthat are also evident in other domains such as sensory perception;\nexamples from visual perception will receive particular attention. And\nin addition to describing what is known about how the underlying\nmechanisms work (something that is understood in more detail in\nsensory contexts than in the case of value-based decision making),\nthe course will consider the extent to which such mechanisms --- while\nsuboptimal from a normative standpoint that treats perfect knowledge\nof one's situation as costless and automatic --- might actually represent\nefﬁcient uses of the limited information and bounded information-\nprocessing resources available to actual people (or other organisms).\nThus the course will consider both ways in which the realism of\neconomic analysis may be improved by taking into account cognitive\nprocesses, and ways in which understanding of cognitive processes\nmight be advanced by considering the economic problem of efﬁcient\nuse of limited (cognitive) resources", "source": "pdfs/barnard 2024-2025.pdf"}

Program in Comparative Literature and Translation Studies\nat Barnard enables students to study literature across languages,\nhistorical periods, national boundaries, and cultural traditions, as well\nas in relation to other arts (such as painting, photography, theater,\nand ﬁlm) and other disciplines (such as philosophy, history, and\nanthropology).  We promote the intensive study of languages and\nrequire majors to work at the advanced level in two literary and cultural\ntraditions in their original languages.  Our teaching emphasizes close\nattention to language: how language changes over time and space;\nhow rhetorical devices enhance and inflect the meaning of what is\nsaid; how narratives tell stories and help us make sense of the world.\n  Resisting a homogenizing globalism, students learn about how\nliterary genres, ideas, and aesthetic forms travel across borders and\nchange in doing so, and they study also diverse cultural practices and\naesthetic forms that defy easy translatability.  We regard the study\nof poetics, the art or technique of writing, as fundamental for and\ninseparable from the study of theory, or critical and philosophical\napproaches to language and discourse.  We teach students the critical\nskills and research methods needed to perform conceptually precise,\naesthetically sensitive, historically-informed, and culturally-attuned\nanalyses and interpretations of texts.\nIn this way, our program provides students with a humanistic education\nlike none other.  It prepares them for the challenges, responsibilities,\nand pleasures of understanding and acting in a complex, richly\ntextured, and multi-lingual world.  It helps them become world citizens\nwhose cosmopolitan outlook is not only world-wide but also world-\ndeep.\nCore faculty members teach the required courses in Comparative\nLiterature and Translation Studies and provide close mentoring. \nStudents have access also to a wealth of faculty expertise in Classics,\nFrench, German, English, Spanish, Asian and Middle Eastern Cultures,\nItalian, Russian, Africana Studies, and Medieval and Renaissance\nStudies, among other departments and programs at Barnard.  Faculty\nwho teach and advise senior theses offer courses on topics that\nrange from sexuality and the body in Greek tragedy to the novella from\nmedieval to modern times, from studies of the novel to comparative\nlyric poetry and poetics, from the writing of utopia to literature and\nphilosophy, from translation and theories of translation to

Studies are matched\nwith an advisor or co-advisors for specialized guidance in selecting\ncourses and designing a curriculum of breadth and depth.  Students\nwho minor in Translation Studies are also matched with an advisor who\nguides them in choosing courses most suitable for the language(s)\nthey work on and in relation to particular interests (such as theater\nor the history of science).  Students beneﬁt also from the array of\nresources in language and literature departments at Columbia. \nWe strongly encourage majors to take advantage of study abroad\nopportunities to immerse themselves in the study of languages and\ncultures.\nOur graduates have embarked upon a variety of career paths, in ﬁelds\nincluding law, journalism, publishing, theater, television, ﬁlm, teaching,\neducation consulting, medicine, gastronomy, public policy, international\nrelations and foreign policy, technology design, and international\nbusiness.  They have received prestigious fellowships, such as the\nFulbright and the Mellon-Mays, to teach and conduct research in\nEurope, Africa, South America, and Asia, and they have gone on to\ngraduate study in political science, comparative literature, East Asian\nStudies, law, history, ﬁlm-making, creative writing, and translation and\ninterpretation, among other subjects, in leading programs all over\nthe world.  Our graduates work as translators, editors, journalists,\nwriters, middle school and high school teachers, college professors,\nﬁlmmakers, lawyers, consultants, technology designers, and public\npolicy advocates in the U.S., South America, Europe, and Asia.  \nStudents who wish to learn more about the major and meet faculty\nmembers should attend our program planning meetings, which take\nplace every fall and spring during the program planning meeting\nperiods at the College.  Students can also contact the chair of the\nprogram to meet during ofﬁce hours or to set up an appointment.\nStudent Learning Outcomes\n• The ability to discern and analyze how formal and rhetorical\nfeatures of language (diction, metaphor, imagery, hyperbole,\nlitotes, rhyme, parallelism, structures of repetition, etc.) enhance,\ninflect, and complicate seemingly straightforward processes\nof communication in literary texts but also in non-literary\ndiscourse, e.g., psychoanalytic case studies, historical narratives,\nphilosophical writing.\n• The ability to analyze literary texts and uses of language in\nhistorical periods, cultural contexts, and social systems that\nare different from one’s own and that can thus help one see and\nre-evaluate one’s own customary and contemporary context in\nproductive ways.\n• Knowledge about the dynamics of the global circulation of literary\ngenres, aesthetic practices, and ideas through processes of\ntranslation and adaptation and by means of various media and\ntechnologies.\n• Knowledge about histories of writing practices, genres, relations\nbetween script and orality, logics of periodization, and ethical\nsystems in traditions and lifeworlds beyond the West.\n• The ability to craft well-reasoned and cogent arguments\nsubstantiated by careful attention to textual evidence and\nknowledge of historical contexts.\n• The ability to use literary and critical theoretical approaches to\nanalyze and interpret texts with deftness and agility, with attention\nto what remains inevitably literary within theoretical discourse\nitself.\n• The ability to do the above–and playfully–in relation to more\nlanguages than one.", "source": "pdfs/barnard

The course is divided into six parts. Part 1 introduces\nDerrida’s approach to ‘deconstruction,’ particularly as regards his\nengagement with the fundamental concepts of Western thought and\nthe importance he confers upon the notion of ‘writing’ itself. Part 2\nexamines Derrida’s autobiographical texts wherein he positions himself\nas a subject for deconstruction, interrogating his own gender, his sense\nof being an organic, creaturely life-form, the relationship he has to his\nown language, and the matter of his identity as French, but also as\nAlgerian, and Jewish. While the majority of the Derrida texts we will be\nreading are excerpts from larger works or short essays and interviews,\nin this section we will read a full-length text – Monolingualism of the\nOther – so that we can trace Derrida’s train of thought from beginning\nto end. In Part 3 we will use an interview conducted by Derek Attridge,\n“This Strange Institution Called Literature,” as a template for thinking\nabout Derrida’s relation to literature, and in Part 4 we will read our\nsecond full-length text by Derrida, namely Given Time 1: Counterfeit\nMoney, an in-depth analysis of a prose poem by the French poet\nCharles Baudelaire. Part 5 considers an aspect of Derrida’s work that\nreveals the extent of his embrace of provisional, in-between positions\nfor thought in general, and for literary texts in particular, namely\ntranslation. For deconstruction is keenly invested in words beginning\nwith ‘trans’: transposition, transplant, trans-valuation, and indeed trans-\ngender. Translation provides Derrida with a scenario whereby crossings\nand transits can be imagined – for literary texts, and for identities that\nwish to remain un-determined by ﬁxed poles or normative values. The\ncourse ﬁnishes with an assessment of Derrida’s reflections on death,\nmourning, and the matter of leaving a legacy. In Part 6, we therefore\nread more of the essay “Living On,” and also Derrida’s ﬁnal interview,\n“Learning to Live, Finally.” Not even Derrida could deconstruct away\nthe ﬁnality of death, but he did hope to live on. My corresponding\nhope is that you will feel sufﬁciently attuned to Derrida’s thought that\nyou consider it important to continue his legacy – to be one of the\nagents of his living on, survival or survie, a translator and transporter\nof his thought towards contexts that he could not have foreseen, but\nwhich he would doubtless have welcomed as a precious chance for\nhis own work to be considered differently. Taking intellectual risks,\nthinking otherwise, and inventing new ways of knowing are, after all,\nthe hallmarks of Derridean deconstruction.\nSpring 2025: CPLT BC3145\nCourse\nNumber\nSection/Call\nNumber\nTimes/Location Instructor Points Enrollment\nCPLT 3145 001/00143 T Th 4:10pm - 5:25pm \n409 Barnard Hall\nBrian O'Keeffe 3 16/25\nCPLT BC3158 Languages of Loss: The Poetry of Mourning. 3 points.\nA study of the genre of elegy across time and cultures.

If most novels\nare, in Raymond Williams’s phrase, “knowable communities,” how do\nﬁctions of the city and imaginings of the country represent individual\nidentity as it is shaped by physical, built environments? In this light,\nwe will consider questions of youth and experience, time and space,\nwork and leisure, men and women, landscape and portraiture, privacy\nand public life, national culture and cosmopolitanism, local custom\nand globalism. In class, we will juxtapose close readings of novels\nwith analyses of other cultural forms (translations, paintings, operas,\npopular entertainment, maps) so that we come away with a broader\nsense of nineteenth-century pan-media culture and its international\nafterlives as well as a working knowledge of one of its most meaningful\nmanifestations: the novel.

The emphasis of our\ndiscussions is on the awkwardness and strangeness of a certain\nkind of prose or drama; we will therefore examine the typical modes\nof transgression and the forms of excess in literary representations\nof the body in various between the 15th century and the present.\nThe transgression may involve the human body, but writers are also\ninterested in the beauty or ugliness of “the beast.” While we will discuss\nquestions of style and linguistic performance, our main concern is the\nhuman imagination: how do characters, narrators and writers relate\nto the strangeness of the body and the world? How is the literary text\nshaped by distinct aesthetic patterns? What kind of taboo subjects\nor problematic and ambiguous aspects of power dynamics in modern\nsocieties can be addressed by presenting humans and animals as\ngrotesque ﬁgures? Our critical discussions of outstanding examples\nof are based on readings of major scholarly contributions to the ﬁeld,\nin particular the studies of internationally recognized intellectuals\nsuch as M.Bakhtin, T.Todorov, J.Kristeva, and W.Kayser. You will be\nintroduced to various historical types of the grotesque, ranging from\nthe ornate and bombastic representations in Renaissance literature\nto the fantastic deformations and hybrid creatures in contemporary\nliterature. The reading material is representative of different cultures,\nlanguages and literatures so that we can conceptualize the grotesque\nfrom a critical and comparative perspective. Ultimately, the grotesque\nis seen as a complicated product of social, political, and cultural\nconditions rather than merely a formal element of a literary discourse.\nThe representation of “grotesque” settings as well as the formation of\n“grotesque” identities will be examined by considering aspects such as\ngender, class, race and ethnicity.\nCPLT BC3200 THE VISUAL AND VERBAL ARTS. 3.00 points.\nAnalysis and discussion of the relation of literature to painting,\nphotography, and ﬁlm.

It focuses on works\nby two Romantic-era authors, Jane Austen (1775-1817) and Heinrich\nvon Kleist (1777-1811), who were contemporaries of one another but\nhave rarely been read together as they inhabited and wrote about vastly\ndifferent milieux. Strikingly, both have been hailed for their precise\nmastery of language and form, their keen sense of irony, and their\nsingularly philosophical dispositions. They wrote at a crucial time\nin both Western and global modernity when European philosophers\nwere re-deﬁning the very activity of judgment itself in relation to new\nunderstandings of reason, truth, and the conditions of knowledge.\nWe will read three of Austen’s six completed novels and a play, short\nstories, a novella, and prose writings by Kleist, paying attention to\nphilosophical problems of self-knowledge, judgment, freedom, and\nautonomy in relation to historical instantiations of gender, class, and\nrace. Besides studying how these early nineteenth-century works\nstaged processes and crises of judgment, we will ask ourselves what\nlessons in judgment these works may continue to offer us today", "source": "pdfs/barnard 2024-2025.pdf"}

While using devices and\nconventions from different narrative traditions, these novels operate in\nthe mode of realism and do so at a monumental and panoramic scale,\ncreating literary worlds that reflect the realia of historical lifeworlds.\nBeyond representing aspects of empirically recognizable worlds,\nthese novels also incorporate philosophical reflection on their own\nmeans of representation, on their very status as ﬁction, on the power\nand limits of imaginative worldmaking. By studying these novels\nas cases of literary worldmaking, we will take the opportunity also\nto reflect critically in this class on the world that emerges–and the\nprocess of worldmaking that gets activated–in our very experience of\nstudying these texts together. We will consider how cosmopolitanism,\nas a guiding ideal of the Enlightenment and post-Enlightenment\nuniversity, may be renewed by literary study to help us inhabit a world\nof common humanity that is richer and more complex than is evident in\nparticularist localisms or a satellite-view, techno-economic globalism.\nMiddlemarch we will read in its entirety. For the sake of time, we will\nread, in David Hawkes’ translation, the 80-chapter version of The Story\nof the Stone, or the Dream of the Red Chamber, attributed to Cao\nXueqin, instead of the 120-chapter version, with the last 40 chapters\nattributed to Gao E.

This course will try to give an answer to this\nvexing question. You are being introduced to a number of influential\npoets who have entered a dialogue about what it means to write, read,\ntranslate and appreciate poetry in a global context. The impact of\nglobalization is most visible in a number of anthologies which made\nconsiderable efforts to move beyond the existing range of national\nrepresentatives and to make an English-speaking audience familiar\nwith the names and works of poets who are bilingual or who write in\ntheir native language. Throughout the semester, we will read English\ntranslations of these poems (but feel free to read the original if you\nknow the language). Secondly, the global context is of great importance\nfor understanding each poet’s vision of the world since poets are\ninvolved in processes of “world-making” as well as reacting to the\nworld’s past and present. s the semester progresses you will see\nthat the poets are part of a larger conversation; some themes, forms\nand issues we discovered at the beginning will return in the middle\nor toward the end of the term. The selection of poets is based on\nconsiderations of gender, race, age and religious afﬁliation; many of\nthe poets whose works we are going to discuss are iconic ﬁgures; in\nstudying other cases, you will be exposed to new voices (for example,\nyoung South African poets) whose signiﬁcance will emerge in a critical\ndiscussion of the anthologists’ rationale and criteria for selecting poets\nand marginalizing others.\nCPLT BC3510 ADVANCED WORKSHOP TRANSLA. 4.00 points.\nMaurice Blanchot once described translators as the “hidden masters\nof culture.” Indeed, though our labor and craft often go unrecognized\nin the age of Google Translate, translators play an essential role\nas tastemakers, bridge-builders, advocates, and diplomats, not to\nmention the most intimate readers and re-writers of literature. In this\nworkshop, we will explore translation as a praxis of writing, reading, and\nrevision. Together, we will also interrogate translation's complex and\noften fraught role in cultural production. What ethical questions does\ntranslation raise? Who gets to translate, and what gets translated?\nWhat is the place of the translator in the text? What can translation\nteach us about language, literature, and ourselves? Readings will\ninclude selections from translation theory, method texts, and literary\ntranslations across genres, from poetry and prose to essay and\nmemoir. Students will workshop original translations into English and\ncomplete brief writing and translation exercises throughout\nFall 2024: CPLT BC3510\nCourse\nNumber\nSection/Call\nNumber\nTimes/Location Instructor Points Enrollment\nCPLT 3510 001/00187 W 11:00am - 12:50pm \n306 Milbank Hall\nJhumpa Lahiri 4.00 6/12\nSpring 2025: CPLT BC3510\nCourse\nNumber\nSection/Call\nNumber\nTimes/Location Instructor Points Enrollment\nCPLT 3510 001/00145 W 4:10pm - 6:00pm \n207 Milbank Hall\nEmily Sun 4.00 4/12\nCPLT BC3551 The Arabian Nights and Its Influences. 4 points.\nThis course examines the enduring power of The Arabian Nights and\nsome of the wide range of literary authors, genres and variations that\nit has influenced.

From early moments of easy-going and\nconﬁdent cosmopolitan travellers, such as Ahmad Faris al-Shidyaq, to\nlater author, such as Tayeb Salih, mapping the existential fault lines\nbetween west and east. For this reason, and as well as being a modern\nphenomenon, the Arabic novel has also been a tool for translation,\nfor bridging gaps and exposing what al-Shidyaq—the man credited\nwith being the father of the modern Arabic novel, and himself a great\ntranslator—called ‘disjunction’. We will begin with his satirical, deeply\ninventive and erudite novel, published in 1855, Leg Over Leg. It is a\nbook with an insatiable appetite for deﬁnitions and comparisons,\nwith Words that had been lost or fell out of use (the author had an\nabiding interest in dictionaries that anticipates Jorge Louis Borges)\nand with locating and often subverting moments of connection and\ndisconnection. We will then follow along a trajectory to the present,\nwhere we will read, in English translation, novels written in Arabic,\nfrom Egypt, Syria, Sudan, Morocco and Palestine. We will read them\nchronologically, starting with Leg Over Leg (1855) and ﬁnishing with\nMinor Detail, a novel that was only published last year.

They can be\nalluring and terrifying, creative and destructive. They wear disguises,\nupend the plans of their fellow humans, and bend societies to their will.\nThey are unsettled and unsettling. But this course suggests that there\nis no single ﬁgure of the trickster. Rather, the signiﬁcance of writing\nabout tricksters and outlaws varies from text to text and from place to\nplace. In this course, we will explore texts, mostly from the pre-modern\nperiod, written in Arabic (and sometimes Persian and Sanskrit) that\ndepict outlaws and tricksters. We will ask after what texts are doing in\nthe world when they tell stories that seem to celebrate and delight in\nthe subversive, the strange, and the sinister.

What inspires, or necessitates,\na writer to practice exophony: to migrate into “foreign” linguistic\nterritory? And in the case of bilingual or plurilingual writers, what\nfactors determine the language(s) chosen for creative expression, and\nwhat might cause that choice to shift over time? To what degree do\nexophonic writers create a third, hybrid language? And how might their\nworks underscore the mutability and instability of language itself?\nThis seminar will focus on a series of women who, either for political\nor personal reasons, have reshaped and revised their linguistic points\nof reference, radically questioning—and perhaps willfully subverting\n—notions of nationality, identity, linguistic normativity, and a “mother\ntongue”. Special attention will be paid to the reception of exophonic\nwriters, to feminist narratives of separation and self-fashioning, to\nmother-daughter dyads, to cases of self-translation, to colonialist and\npost-colonialist frameworks, and to how the phenomenon of exophony\nfurther complicates, but also enriches, the translator’s task. Readings\nwill combine literary texts with essays, interviews, and theoretical\nwritings by and about exophonic writers.

We start with\nthe fundamentals of sound in the digital domain, covering issues of\nrepresentation and audio synthesis. We then move through various\nsynthesis techniques including the additive, subtractive, frequency\nmodulation (FM), and amplitude modulation (AM) synthesis. After\ncovering some core DSP techniques, we put these concepts into\nperformative practice by exploring “live coding”. In the space of\nlive coding, we examine various programming language designs to\nunderstand how various domain speciﬁc languages (DSLs) support\nlive coding. For the third module, we turn our focus to automated\ncomposition and analysis, addressing challenges in music information\nretrieval, generative art, and autonomous improvisation systems.

The major builds upon studio courses, the Department's\nproductions at Miller Theater, New York Live Arts, and other venues,\nas well as a rich array of dance studies courses, allowing students'\ncreative work to develop in dialogue with critical inquiry into the history,\nculture, theory and forms of western and non-western performance,\ntypically enhanced by study in other disciplines. Students work with\naccomplished artists whose work enriches contemporary American\ndance; they also study with outstanding research scholars.\nMaking, thinking about, and writing about art are an essential part of\nthe liberal arts education. For this reason, the Department of Dance\noffers technique courses for students of all levels of expertise, while\nopening its other courses to majors and non-majors alike, who may\nalso audition for its productions. The Department partners with cultural\ninstitutions in New York City to connect students with the professional\nworld.\nStudent Learning Outcomes\nStudents graduating with a major in Dance should be able to attain the\nfollowing outcomes:\n• Apply critical thinking, reading, and writing skills to dance-related\ntexts and choreography.\n• Develop the knowledge and research skills to explore the dance\npast in writing, orally, and in performance.\n• Present interpretations of dance-related texts orally, in writing, and\nin performance.\n• Apply library, archival, and internet research skills to dance\nscholarship and choreography.\n• Demonstrate improved efﬁciency and expressivity in dance\ntechnique.", "source": "pdfs/barnard 2024-2025.pdf"}

You\nmust attend the ﬁrst 2 classes. \nRehearsal and Performance DNCE BC 3601- DNCE BC 3607 requires an\naudition usually scheduled for the ﬁrst week of classes.\nTransfer Credit\n• When students wish to transfer credit to Barnard from other\ninstitutions, their coursework is ﬁrst evaluated for college elective\ncredit by the Registrar’s Ofﬁce. If they are approved, departments\ncan consider these courses for credit toward the major or minor.\n• Transfer students should send their transcripts to the Dance\nDepartment Chair for credit evaluation. \nStudy Abroad Credit\n• Classes taken abroad through Columbia-led programs (i.e., those\nadministered by Columbia's Center for Global Engagement) are\ntreated as Columbia courses, equivalent to those taken on the\nMorningside Heights campus.\n• Classes taken abroad through other institutions or programs are\ntreated as transfer credit and are subject to the same policies as\nother transfer courses.  Accordingly, there will be a limit on the\nnumber of study abroad courses taken at other institutions that\ncan be counted toward the major or minor.\n• To receive credit toward the major or minor for a study abroad\ncourse (whether taken through a Columbia program or another\ninstitution/program), students must submit a Study Abroad\nApproval form through Slate and obtain the approval of the Chair or\ndepartmental representative.\nSummer Credit\n• Summer courses at Barnard are equivalent to those taken during\nthe academic year.  Courses that have been approved for the\nfulﬁllment of departmental requirements will automatically count\ntoward your major.\n• Courses taken at other institutions (including Columbia) are\nconsidered transfer credit and are subject to the same governing\nother transfer courses.  To receive major or minor credit for a\nsummer course taken at another institution, students must submit\na Summer Course form through Slate and have it approved by both\nthe Registrar's Ofﬁce and the Chair or departmental representative.\nSenior Capstone Project\nSenior Seminar (DNCE BC3591) is the capstone experience of your\nyears of study as a dance major. It is probably the most challenging\ncourse you will take in the Department, because for so much of the\ntime you will be working on your own, and because the thesis is\nprobably the longest and most complex piece of analytical writing that\nyou will undertake in college. No matter what your area of interest,\nyou need to come up with a topic, create a bibliography, develop an\noriginal thesis, conduct in-depth research, and build a convincing\nargument in support of your claims. This is not a project that you\ncan do overnight. By the same token, it is one that will stand you in\ngood stead even if you never write another word about your topic. The\nprocess of conceptualizing, researching, writing, and revising a thesis –\nand the skills all this entails – will carry over into realms of activity very\nfar from dance.\nSenior Project: Repertory for Dance (DNCE BC 3593) is the culminating\nexperience of your major work and is based on research, investigation,\ninterpretation, and the creative synthesis of movement. As with Senior\nSeminar, there will be a good amount of time in which you are working\non your own, whether it is creating the movement language and\nmanaging your rehearsal schedule (including studio space requests\nto the Technical Director), attending to the music-sound needs of your\nwork with the Music Director, exploring multi-media possibilities, or\ncreating/recreating/staging choreography or designing/resourcing\ncostumes for your work. Students will work on their own creative\nproject as well as offering support for each other’s work throughout the\nsemester.\nChair: Colleen Thomas-Young (Professor of Professional Practice in\nDance) \nProfessor: Paul A.

The major encourages students\nto develop an understanding of the human experience through the\nrecord of the past and acquire intellectual tools to analyze historical\nchanges from an economic and social perspective. Students are\nexposed to different ways of thinking about the origins of capitalism,\nthe structural features of modern economies, regional differences or\nglobal diversity in long-run economic performance and socioeconomic\nwell-being, and the challenges and opportunities facing the global\neconomy today. By looking at both the social and the economic\ndimensions of the histories of one or more geographical regions,\nstudents gain a valuable interdisciplinary perspective that enables\nthem to appreciate and think systematically and critically about the\ncomplexities of human interaction.\nStudent Learning Outcomes\nStudents who complete the major in Economic and Social History will\nbe able to attain the following:\n• Show fluency in basic concepts, models and tools of economic\ntheory and economic history.\n• Understand the difference between primary and secondary\nsources, and use and evaluate these materials through critical\nreading and interpretation.\n• Demonstrate understanding of institutions, organizations and\nmarkets in their roles of coordinating economic and social activity.\n• Use concepts or methods from multiple disciplines including\neconomics to analyze the past.\n• Articulate a well-deﬁned research question and conduct\nindependent research using economic reasoning and historical\nevidence.\n• Communicate economic ideas and historical concepts effectively\nin written or oral form.\n• Demonstrate knowledge and capacity to do in-depth research\non a particular geographic area, time period, or central theme in\neconomic and social history.\n• Demonstrate knowledge of the history of economic thought, its\nrelation to historical developments, and influence on past and\npresent economic theory and ideas.\n• Show an appreciation for different historiographic approaches to\nthe study of economic and social history.\n• Show familiarity with varied perspectives on the origins of\ncapitalism and the diversity of economic development across\nregions.\nStudents who graduate with a major in Economic and Social History\nwill be prepared to enter graduate programs in history, business, public\npolicy/administration, or to pursue careers such as in public policy or\nbusiness that call for diverse perspectives and skills.\nThis program is supervised by the Committee on Economic and Social\nHistory:\nProgram Committee: Alan Dye (Economics), Gergely Baics (History),\nDavid Weiman (Economics), and Carl Wennerlind (History).\nRequirements for the Major\nThe Economic and Social History track requires a minimum of 12\ncourses (39 minimum credits).\nEconomics\nTheoretical Perspectives:\nECON BC1003 Introduction to Economic Reasoning 3\nECON BC3041 THEORETICL FOUNDTNS-POLIT ECON 3\nECON BC3033 INTERMEDTE MACROECONOMC\nTHEORY *\n4\nEconomic History\nSelect two of the following, including at least one course (at the 3000\nlevel or higher):\n6\nECON BC2012 Economic History of Western Europe\nECHS BC2590 MEASURING HISTORY\nECON BC3013 Economic History of the United States\n(another upper-level economic history\ncourse may be substituted, subject to\neconomics adviser's approval)\nECON BC3022 Economic History of Europe\nECON BC3023 Topics in Economic History\nHistory\nIntroductory Course in ﬁeld of historical specialization:\nSelect one of the following: 3\nHIST BC1062 Introduction to the Global Middle Ages\nHIST BC1101 EUROPEAN HISTORY 1500-1789\nHIST BC1302 EUROPEAN HISTORY SINCE 1789\nHIST BC1401 INTRODUCTION TO AMERICAN\nHISTORY TO 1865\nHIST BC1402 INTRODUCTION TO AMERICAN\nHISTORY SINCE 1865\nHIST BC1760 INTRO AFRICAN HIST:1700-PRESNT\nHIST BC1801 Colonialism and Nationalism in South\nAsia\nLecture Courses:\nSelect two of the following: 6\nHIST BC2116 The History of Money 3\nHIST BC2180 Merchants, Pirates, and Slaves in the\nMaking of Atlantic Capitalism\n3\nHIST BC2321 COLONIAL ENCOUNTERS 3", "source": "pdfs/barnard 2024-2025.pdf"}

To achieve this aim\nour curriculum\n• Provides a thorough grounding in neoclassical economic theory,\nmodern statistical method, and their applications in the traditional\nﬁelds of economic science;\n• Embeds that training in a broader conception of economic science\nand method with special emphasis on philosophical, historical,\nand institutional approaches that link economics with other social\nsciences and humanistic disciplines;\n• Compares and contrasts alternative methodological approaches\nand types of evidence as ways of analyzing economic phenomena,\nevaluating policy debates, and assessing the broader social and\npolitical consequences of economic doctrines.\nStudent Learning Outcomes\nHaving successfully completed the major in Economics, the student\nwill be able to attain the following outcomes:\n1. Show fluency in the basic concepts, models and tools of\nmicroeconomic and macroeconomic theory;\n2. Think critically about economic phenomena and economic\ndebates by using multiple kinds of texts, evidence and conceptual\napproaches;\n3. Apply economic reasoning to understand the causal determinants\nof economic events, empirical regularities, and policy proposals;\n4. Apply basic skills of empirical reasoning to economic problems;\n5. Demonstrate knowledge of the history of economic thought,\nincluding important doctrines, their historical context,\ntransformation over time, and influence on contemporary economic\ntheory and ideas;\n6. Demonstrate understanding of institutions, organizations and\nmarkets in their roles of coordinating economic activity;\n7. Demonstrate knowledge of the historical origins of capitalism,\nmodern economic growth and development, patterns of inequality,\nand globalization;\n8. Articulate a well-deﬁned research question and conduct\nindependent research using economic reasoning and evidence;\n9. Communicate economic ideas effectively in written or oral form.\nSpeciﬁc to the Economics Track\n1. Understand and apply statistical techniques to make inferences\nabout economic hypotheses.\nSpeciﬁc to the Political Economy Track\n1. Use concepts or methods from at least one disciplinary approach\nother than economics to analyze an economic, political or other\nsocial problem.\nAdvanced Placement Credit\nBarnard will allow a total of 3 points AP credit in Economics only if\nthe following conditions are satisﬁed: an AP score of 4 or 5 in either\nMacro or Micro (or both), or an International Baccalaureate (IB) score\nof 5 or higher.  However, students who receive AP credit for economics\nand who go on to pursue any of the economics department majors\n(or an economics minor) must still take  ECON BC1003 Introduction to\nEconomic Reasoning  or its equivalent.\nFor Statistics, Barnard will allow 3 points credit with a score of 5 on\nthe Statistics AP exam. Economics track majors, however, will not be\nexempt from the statistics requirement ECON BC2411 STATISTICS FOR\nECONOMICS or the equivalent, even if they receive 3 points AP credit\nfor Statistics.\nChair:  Homa Zarghamee (Professor) \nProfessors:   Elizabeth Ananat (Mallya Professor of Women and\nEconomics), André Burgstaller (Emeritus), Alan Dye, Daniel Hamermesh\n(Distinguished Scholar), Sharon Harrison, Lalith Munasinghe,  Rajiv\nSethi, David Weiman (Alena Wels Hirschorn '58 Professor) \nAssociate Professor: Belinda Archibong \nAssistant Professors: Anja Benshaul-Tolonen, Martina Jasova, Morgan\nWilliams \nTerm Associate Professor:  Mulu Gebreyohannes (Weiss International\nFellow) ", "source": "pdfs/barnard 2024-2025.pdf"}

The track in Economics emphasizes\nmodern economic theory along with associated analytical and\nmathematical tools.  The track in Political Economy emphasizes the\nroots of modern economics in the history of economic thought and\nthe interconnections between social forces, political institutions, and\neconomic power. Either track offers excellent preparation for graduate\nstudy in a variety of professional schools and professional careers in\nmany areas, including business and public administration.\nProspective majors should discuss their programs with any member of\nthe department no later than the second semester of their sophomore\nyear. At the time of declaring the major, the student meets with the\ndepartment chair and chooses a major adviser, who will advise her\non the choice of program and courses. Students planning to major in\nEconomics or Political Economy should complete both intermediate\nmacro- and microeconomic theory by the beginning of their junior year.\nStudents who wish to complete a double or joint major that\nincludes Economics should consult the chair of the department\nor the major adviser as early as possible. Students interested in\npursuing a Ph.D. in economics should take more mathematics than\nrequired for the economics major or choose the Economics and\nMathematics interdisciplinary major.

Education is a fundamental human activity that\noccurs in formal and informal settings as people interact within their\nsocial, historical, and physical environments. The program educates\nstudents to draw on interdisciplinary research and perspectives in\norder to critically analyze the role of education in society, and to create\nand sustain equitable educational practices and policies for all.\nPROGRAMS OF STUDY\nThe Barnard Education Program is committed to strengthening\npublic education and addressing issues of equity and social justice,\nparticularly in urban schools. We offer two tracks in Education:\nEducation Studies (Major and Minor/Special Concentration), and\nUrban-Teaching Minors/Special Concentration (that leads to teacher\ncertiﬁcation in Elementary/Childhood Education or Secondary-\nAdolescent Education).  In all tracks, students develop critical lenses\nto understand  education as a fundamental human activity that occurs\nacross many settings; to analyze the issues facing public schools; and\nto consider ways to promote fair and inclusive policies and practices\nfor children and youth. The classes are  open to all undergraduates at\nColumbia (BC, SEAS, GS, CC). The two tracks we offer are:\nEducation Studies", "source": "pdfs/barnard 2024-2025.pdf"}
{"page_index": 289, "page_content": "Barnard College Catalogue 2024-2025 289\nEducation Studies is an interdisciplinary program for students who\nwish to understand, critically analyze, and conduct research on the\nrole of education in society. Our students draw on a wide range of\ntheoretical and empirical scholarship to study education as a social,\ncultural, and historical process. We understand education as much\nmore than schooling, even as schooling is central to many of our\nconcerns. Students who pursue the major or the minor/special\nconcentration in Education Studies learn to evaluate educational\npolicy, practice, and research through a critical, equity-oriented\nlens. Our graduates will be prepared to act creatively for peace,\njustice, and sustainability in local and global educational contexts.\nEducation Studies prepares students to pursue graduate studies or\npositions in public policy, sociology, history, youth studies, philosophy,\npsychology, and other areas where K-12 education is frequently a\nfocus of coursework and scholarship, as well as to pursue teacher\ncertiﬁcation through a graduate program. Education Studies does not\nlead to teacher certiﬁcation.\n          Education Studies Major: The Education Studies major is\ndesigned for students whose primary interest is in pursuing Education\nas their major course of study. Education Studies majors concentrate\nin one of three areas: Education, Culture, and Society; Educational\nPolicy; or Comparative and International Education. In their senior\nyear, they conduct an original inquiry project. Currently, the major in\nEducation Studies is open to Barnard College students only.\n          Education Studies Minor/Special Concentration: Education\nStudies minors (BC) or special concentrations (CC, GS) pursue similar\ncoursework to that  undertaken by the majors. This course of study\nis  intended to complement a major's disciplinary specialization and\nmethodological training. In addition to the requirements of the minor/\nspecial concentration, students must complete a major. The special\nconcentration minors are open to all students at Barnard College,\nColumbia College, and College of General Studies.\nFor further information, and to apply to the major or minor tracks,\nplease visit our website\nUrban Teaching Minors/Special Concentrations\nThis track is for students who want to graduate from college with\nteacher certiﬁcation. Our goal is to prepare students to become\nskilled and reflective teachers who can effectively respond to\nthe learning needs of diverse learners, and create supportive and\nintellectually stimulating classroom communities. Students learn\nto create innovative curriculum; gain experience observing, tutoring,\nand teaching a diverse range of children and young people; develop\nconﬁdence in their role as teachers who can promote fair and inclusive\nschool practices; and graduate with certiﬁcation to teach in New York. \nThis program is registered by the New York State Department of\nEducation and accredited by the Association for Advancing Quality in\nEducator Preparation (AAQEP). Students who complete the program\nwill be recommended for Initial Certiﬁcation in either Childhood\nEducation (Grades 1-6) or Adolescent Education (Grades 7-12). We\nprovide ongoing support to program completers through our Barnard\nTeacher Network.\nTo apply to the Urban Teaching tracks, please visit our website.\nStudents are encouraged to apply for admission by March of the\nsophomore year but no later than April 30th of their sophomore year.\nThose who plan to study abroad during junior year should apply by\nthe spring of the freshman year, but no later than the ﬁrst Tuesday\nin September of the sophomore year.  Admission criteria include\ngood academic standing; evidence of commitment to the ﬁeld of\neducation; interest in issues of social justice issues as they affect\neducation, particularly in urban schools; and capacity for growth as an\nintellectually resourceful and reflective teacher.

The\nSeminar in Urban Education explores the historical, political and socio-\ncultural dynamics of urban education in the U.S. context. Over time,\na range of social actors have intervened in the “problem” of urban\neducation, attempting to reshape and reform urban schools.

Despite decades of wide\nranging reform efforts, however, many urban schools still fail to provide\ntheir students with an adequate, equitable education. Seminar in Urban\nEducation investigates this paradox by pursuing three central course\nquestions: 1) How have various social actors tried to achieve equity\nin urban schools over time? 2) What are the range and variation of\nassets and challenges found in urban schools? and 3) Considering this\nhistory and context, what would effective reform in a global city like\nNYC look like?

In the past few years, we have\nwitnessed a surge in homophobic, racist, misogynist, and xenophobic\nrhetoric in our society and our schools. At the same time, teachers in\nclassrooms across this country have been engaged in the difﬁcult work\nof challenging oppression and injustice in their schools, communities,\nand nation. These teachers know that the future of our democracy is\nat stake. Using a historical and sociological framework, this course\nexamines the past and present conditions that have led to political\npolarization, escalating inequality, and persistent injustice. It seeks\nto examine the lineage of racism, sexism, nativism, and imperialism\non our nation and its schools and to consider the extent to which\nthese challenges are uniquely American or part of a more global\nphenomenon. It offers an introduction to the deep current of American\nsocial, political, and economic culture that many argue has produced\nthe challenges that our nation faces today: personal and political\ngain marred by intolerance, derived from wealth, and rooted in the\nhistory of segregation, sexism, and exploitation. Instead of seeing\nthese challenges as separate entities, the course acknowledges the\nintersectional nature of power and politics. Students will consider\nhow these conditions affect their roles as educators and the lives of\nthe youth and families in their schools and communities. They will\nleave the course with a deeper appreciation and understanding of\nthe historical and sociological antecedents that have contributed to\npolarization, inequity, and injustice around the globe\nCross-Listed Courses\nECON BC3012 THE ECONOMICS OF EDUCATION. 3.00 points.\nPrerequisites: ECON BC3035 and ECON BC2411 or permission of\nthe instructor.

SPACE, URB SCHOOLS. 3.00 points.\nMany people don’t think of themselves as having attended segregated\nschools. And yet, most of us went to schools attended primarily by\npeople who looked very much like us. In fact, schools have become\nmore segregated over the past 30 years, even as the country becomes\nincreasingly multiracial. In this class, we will use public schools as an\nexample to examine the role race plays in shaping urban spaces and\ninstitutions. We will begin by unpacking the concept of racialization, or\nthe process by which a person, place, phenomenon, or characteristic\nbecomes associated with a certain race. Then, we will explore the\nfollowing questions: What are the connections between city schools\nand their local contexts? What does it mean to be a “neighborhood\nschool”? How do changes in neighborhoods change schools? We will\nuse ethnographies, narrative non-ﬁction, and educational research to\nexplore these questions from a variety of perspectives. You will apply\nwhat you have learned to your own experiences and to current debates\nover urban policies and public schools.

Section 1 (taught by Brionne Janae): Updated course\ndescription forthcoming Section 2 (taught by Farnoosh Fathi): “In\nthe beginner’s mind, possibilities are many, in the expert’s mind,\nthere are few.” — Shunryu Suzuki, Zen Mind, Beginner’s Mind In this\nintroductory poetry writing workshop, we will cultivate an ardently\nplayful approach to writing, one committed to honoring “beginner’s\nmind.” Embarrassment, error and amateurism will be embraced as\nvalues and fertile grounds (rather than obstructions) for writing.\nTogether we will explore poetry writing as the pursuit and expression\nof a liberatory language–the language of our highest attention and\nfreedom– shared between reader and writer. In addition to workshops,\nwe will alternate between classes centered on formal and thematic\nstudies with others focussed on contemplative practices and the\nwriting process. Formal and revisionary explorations will be guided\nby the experiments of Bernadette Mayer, Inger Christensen, Dadaists\nand the Oulipo; by generative varieties of translation as practiced by\nMónica de la Torre and Sawako Nagasaku–homophonic and self-\ntranslation; the role of inside jokes and an innocent attention to our\nenvironment, inspired by Gertrude Stein and Wadih Saadeh. Drawing on\nteachings by Corita Kent, art exercises by Kim Beom and Zen Buddhist\nrituals we will learn contemplative practices that help us create,\ncombine and consider our attention in order to see how receptive,\nopen, beginner’s mind effort, rather than forced determination toward a\nparticular outcome, underpins our deepest work in writing\nFall 2024: ENGL BC3110\nCourse\nNumber\nSection/Call\nNumber\nTimes/Location Instructor Points Enrollment\nENGL 3110 001/00716 W 4:10pm - 6:00pm \n225 Milbank Hall\nBrionne Janae 3.00 8/12\nENGL 3110 002/00759 T 4:10pm - 6:00pm \n324 Milbank Hall\nMiranda Field 3.00 6/12\nSpring 2025: ENGL BC3110\nCourse\nNumber\nSection/Call\nNumber\nTimes/Location Instructor Points Enrollment\nENGL 3110 001/00572 T 4:10pm - 6:00pm \n237 Milbank Hall\nAngel Naﬁs 3.00 12/12\nENGL BC3113 PLAYWRITING I. 3.00 points.\nPrerequisites: Open only to juniors and seniors.

This course is an intensive writing workshop focused on the\nart of flash ﬁction—stories told in under 1,500 words. The workshop\nwill emphasize experimentation, encouraging students to push the\nboundaries of traditional storytelling by playing with form, language,\nand perspective. Readings will include works originally written in\nEnglish as well as those in translation, offering a broad view of global\napproaches to flash ﬁction. Discussions will cover the mechanics\nof storytelling on a compressed scale, including structure, character\ndevelopment, point of view, dialogue, and style. Authors will include\nCheever, Couto, Hempel, Davis, and Wang, and through these readings,\nstudents will explore the structural possibilities of the short form, the\nrole of voice, and the ways in which brevity can intensify narrative\nimpact. The class will examine how compression, omission, and\nimplication create resonance in ﬁction.Each student will write and\nworkshop three original short pieces, receiving detailed feedback from\npeers and the instructor. The goal is to develop a keen sense of how\nthe economy of language can create depth and complexity in ﬁction.\nSection 2 (taught by Idra Novey): Old Wolves and New Grandmothers.\nOnce upon a time there was a ﬁction workshop and each student in\nthe workshop conjured a new role for the animal in their grandmother’s\nbed. In this workshop, we’ll experiment with how the tone and iconic\nﬁgures of fairy tales may provide a way into a new work of ﬁction,\nthough not necessarily a way out. We’ll talk about myriad ways to\nsubvert the expected meaning of the wolf and the wicked in our own\ntime, and what new subtexts may be lurking in the shared stories we\nreconsider at different points in our lives. “You shift time and location\nto see what holds true, and why or why not,” novelist Helen Oyeyemi\nsays of the allure of fairy tales as a place of departure for a new work of\nﬁction.

We will consider the essay in the original and most open-\nended sense of the term—coming from French, essai, meaning\n“attempt.\" This type of essay is also known as a personal essay.\nThe personal essay is a paradoxical form. It makes rules and then\nbreaks them. It announces itself and then slips out the backdoor. It\nis a mischief-maker and the successful essayist remembers that,\nremembers to stay playful. And that's what our workshop will be about.\nAs we attempt to write and share our stories, let’s ask one another:\n“what’s the fun of this story?” Let’s urge each other to see how can that\nfun remain, adhere, and grow through the drafting process. Most of all,\nlet's use the essay to explore our relationship to writing overall. Phillip\nLopate writes that the essay “sets up a relationship with the reader, a\ndialogue—a friendship.” Seeing the sentence as a set of relationships,\none tied to our human relations, we will write and revise with the hope\nof fostering an enduring relationship with the page. Writers should\nexpect to workshop at least twice, working toward a ﬁnal portfolio of\n15-20 double-spaced pages.

Drawing on the possibilities of\ninterdisciplinary analysis and creative non-ﬁction, this course aims to\nuse quotidian objects to critically engage with the city, re-rendering\nthose objects extraordinary and telling untold stories. The starting\npoints for our investigation are ten concrete objects – some iconic,\nsome ironic, but all characteristic of New York City.

The devils\nof these plays are disruptive, anarchic, seductive and repulsive. They\nare rhetorically bewitching and morally dangerous. This course will\npay close attention to these devils and their devilry. What do they\ndo? How do they speak? What do they know and what choice do they\nhave in being so diabolical? Rather than viewing devils simply as\nspiritual antagonists, instead we will investigate them as complex\ncreatures doing serious theological work in the difﬁcult and spiritually\ntumultuous towns of late medieval England.

The goal of this class is to read Hurston closely and\nwidely and to identify and examine her aesthetic philosophy and\nstylistic choices as one of the ﬁrst African American women able\nto have a writing “career.” We will concentrate on her work from the\n1920s through the 1930s, when she was at Barnard, and a leading\nﬁgure in the Harlem/New Negro Renaissance. In her time, Hurston\nwas adamant about writing for and about people like herself; she\nsaw ordinary black people as keepers of a rich culture that should be\ncelebrated and shared. In this spirit, the assignments for this course\nwill lead to ﬁnal digital projects that can be shared with the Barnard\ncommunity in anticipation of the centennial of Hurston’s matriculation\nand graduation from Barnard (1925-1928).

Deﬁned by humanism, the Protestant Reformation, and\nrevolution, this was a period of ideological struggle on many levels.\nLong-held ways of ordering the world came under increasing strain-\nand sometimes ruptured irreparably. Writers discussed and debated\nthe aims of human knowledge, retooled old literary forms for new\npurposes, scrambled to take account of an expanded awareness of the\nglobe, and probed the tension between belief and doubt. Throughout\nthis process, they experimented with new literary styles to express their\nrapidly changing worldviews.

The term “metaphysical” to refer to his poetry was ﬁrst used\nby Samuel Johnson in the 18th century. It was popularized in the 20th\ncentury by T. S. Eliot, who lamented what he called a “dissociation of\nsensibility” that set in during the 17th century, whereas (Eliot said)\n“a thought to Donne was an experience,” as if mind was not simply a\nseparate thing from embodied experience. Donne’s poetry has long\nbeen admired, indeed loved, embraced by later readers, writers, and\nartists—not just in England and America but in different parts of the\nworld. He has left a rich legacy, and what Judith Scherer Herz calls his\n“voiceprint” on diverse later writers. In my experience, students always\nwant to spend more time on Donne. In this course, we will do that,\nreading his poetry with attention but also his prose Devotions Upon\nEmergent Occasions, written in 1623 during the plague when he came\nclose to dying. The Devotions found a new life during the AIDs crisis,\nand then again during our Covid pandemic. The line from the Devotions\nthat begins “No man is an island” has been part of our culture for a\ncentury, though many have no idea where it comes from. In this course,\nwe will engage in “attentive,” patient reading of his texts, entering in\nthem, trying to ﬁguring them out, much as Donne sought to ﬁgure\nout lived experience in richly metaphorical writing. Though Donne is\nat the center of the course, we will also read a selection of poems\nby other 17th-century Metaphysical poets—George Herbert, Henry\nVaughan, Katherine Philips, Andrew Marvell—and Sir Thomas Browne’s\nprose Hydriotaphia: Or Urn Burial, occasioned by the excavation of\nancient burial urns discovered in Norwich. Browne tries to ﬁgure out\nthe identity of these urns, then moves to a fascinating survey of the\nburial practices of different cultures over a long period of time, and\nthen concludes with a profound meditation on memory, legacy, and our\ndesire for immortality, perpetuating our earthly connections. Donne left\nan impression on so many writers such as Yeats, Dylan Thomas, and\nSeamus Heaney; Emily Dickinson, Elizabeth Bishop, and Adrienne Rich;\nDjuna Barnes (her novel Nightwood, a lesbian classic), Robert Lowell\nand Anthony Hecht, the Bengali Rabinadrath Tagore; Joseph Brodsky,\nYehudah Amichai and Leonard Cohen; Linda Gregerson, and Kimberly\nJohnson. So many possibilities for anyone interested in exploring\nbeyond the limits of syllabus. Donne’s poetry has had (and continues to\nhave) a transhistorical and transcultural currency.

To\naddress this question, we will explore how Victorian novels both\nresponded to, and participated in, major social and cultural shifts of\nthe period, including industrialism and urbanization; colonialism and\nempire; the changing status of women, sexuality, and marriage; the\nemergence of Darwinism; class conflict and social reform; and the\nexpansion of education and literacy. This course will also consider\nmore broadly what novels are for, and what the Victorians thought they\nwere for. Do novels represent the world as it really is, or do they imagine\nit as it ought to be? What kinds of solutions to social and political\nproblems can novels offer? Can novels ethically improve (or corrupt)\ntheir readers? We will consider these issues in the context of realism,\nVictorian literature’s trademark genre, but we’ll also explore an array\nof other genres, such as the industrial novel, the Bildungsroman, the\nsensation novel, detective ﬁction, and gothic ﬁction.

This course examines the\ndevelopment of literary ﬁction in response to history. Through a diverse\nselection of books—novels, novellas, and verse—spanning nearly 2400\nyears, we will investigate the seemingly contradictory condition of the\nauthor as both outsider and insider. We will look at how writers from\nvarious backgrounds have addressed social and political alienation,\nnational and personal crisis, through narrative. The uniqueness of\nthe texts lies not just in how implicated they are in history, but in their\nresistance against generalization and intolerance. Two areas of critical\nconcern govern the selection: Romanticism brings to focus responses\nto estrangement and injustice; and Modernism is seen as individual\nexpression to alienation and exile. However, implicit also is the desire\nto complicate the distinction between those two schools. What unites\nthese concerns, however, is how our writers’ artistic commitment, as\nboth witnesses and participants, creates an opportunity for literature to\nreveal more than the author intends and, on the other hand, more than\nwhat power desires", "source": "pdfs/barnard 2024-2025.pdf"}

The latter\nform of imitation raises the most overtly socio-political questions,\nwhether by replicating social power structures in order to “pass”\nin a potentially hostile environment or by subverting these same\nstructures through mimicking, outwitting, critiquing, or mocking\nthem. At its core, the category of imitation focuses our attention on\nwhat is so central to artmaking that it almost eludes our notice: the\nquestion of resemblance.

This course will accordingly explore\nthe more adventurous and speculative ﬁction of the Victorian period\nthat was most closely attuned to these new ways of representing\nand thinking about reality. How did new scientiﬁc developments\nsuch as evolutionary theory in biology, and the atomic theory in\nphysics, reshape how writers viewed the relationships between\nhuman and animal, self and other, space and time, body and mind?\nHow did departing from traditional realist modes enable Victorian\nscience ﬁction writers to explore the ethical, social, and political\nimplications of scientiﬁc theories in ways that scientiﬁc prose may\nnot have envisioned? In this course we will read major works of\nVictorian ﬁction, by such authors as Mary Shelley, H.G. Wells, H. Rider\nHaggard, Robert Louis Stevenson, and others, alongside selections of\nscientiﬁc prose in such ﬁelds of Victorian science as biology, physics,\nmathematics, anthropology, and psychology. Throughout the course,\nwe will understand “science” to include both major developments in the\nhistory of science, such as the emergence of evolutionary thought, as\nwell as more eccentric Victorian areas of inquiry, such as phrenology,\nmesmerism, telepathy, and degeneration. The ﬁrst three units into\nwhich the course is divided each explore a major ﬁeld of Victorian\nscience alongside a major conceptual category that it challenged\nand altered: biology and the nature of the human; psychology and the\nconstitution of the self; the physical sciences and the nature of space\nand time. In each unit, we will investigate how writers’ engagements\nwith these conceptual questions led them to experiment with literary\ncategories such as character, narration, and plot. The course will close\nwith a unit on texts that more broadly address Victorian conceptions\nof progress, technology, and development. In addition to these speciﬁc\nthematic and formal questions, we will think broadly about how the\nVictorians understood the value of science and technology in relation\nto the arts and to literature, and ask what their answers to these\nquestions can offer us as we navigate similar questions today. What\ndoes scientiﬁc thinking offer to literature, and what kinds of questions\ncan literature answer that scientiﬁc prose cannot?

What do\ntheir works tell us about gender, land, and labor? We explore themes\nof sovereignty against settler colonialism in the work of indigenous\nwriters like Kandiaronk, William Apess, E. Pauline Johnson, Sarah\nWinnemucca, Zitkala Sa, and Liliuokalani, Queen of Hawaii. Next,\nwe read the African American abolitionist tradition, beginning with\nPhillis Wheatley and slave narratives (Frederick Douglass, Mary Prince,\nHarriet Jacobs) followed by works by Harriet Wilson, Ida B. Wells, and\nMachado de Assis. The ﬁnal third of the class will focus on works by\nthose encountering imperialism in Egypt, South Asia, Latin America, the\nPhilippines, and China: Al-Jabarti, Dinabandhu Mitra, José Martí, Jose\nRizal, Huang Zunxian, and Qiu Jin\nENGL BC3243 ABSENT MOTHERS, WICKED STEPMOTHERS. 4.00\npoints.\nWhy are stepmothers and stepdaughters inevitable enemies in folk\nand fairy tales? Why are fathers blameless and biological mothers\nabsent (and usually dead)? And how do these narratives, so deeply\nwoven into our own media and language, affect our sense of our own\nlived reality? In this course, we’ll untangle the complicated web of\nrelationships between mothers, daughters, and stepmothers in folk and\nfairy tales, from ancient Rome to current cinema. We’ll read analytic\npsychology, feminist literary theory, cultural history, and other critical\nperspectives to help us analyze the absent mother, virginal daughter,\nhapless father, and evil stepmother tropes across time and space,\nso we can defamiliarize these familiar ﬁgures and develop a deeper\nunderstanding of how and why they dominate the popular imagination.\nThis is an upper-level course, with priority for juniors and seniors\nFall 2024: ENGL BC3243\nCourse\nNumber\nSection/Call\nNumber\nTimes/Location Instructor Points Enrollment\nENGL 3243 001/00531 T 4:10pm - 6:00pm \n406 Barnard Hall\nWendy Schor-\nHaim\n4.00 15/15\nENGL BC3244 PROUST: SWANN’S WAY. 4.00 points.\nThis class is organised around one book, Swann’s Way, volume one of\nMarcel Proust’s magnum opus, In Search of Lost Time, a work that is\ncentral to the history of the novel. Due to the length and complexity\nof the six volumes that make up In Search of Lost Time, it is not a\nnovel that beneﬁts from a schematic reading. It calls, instead, on our\nattention to be paid in an unusually close manner. It is a novel that is\ncommitted to the details, to close observation and the expansive and\nmeditative nature of the life of the mind. Therefore, as well as being\nabout Proust’s work, the class is also concerned with questions of\nattention. As Adorno argued, In Search of Lost Time is a book that\nis “against the brutal untruth of a subsuming form forced on from\nabove…” Students will get a chance to read Swann’s Way—a book\nthat is just under 500 pages long—in great depth over the course\nof the semester. And because the adjective “Proustian”, it could be\nargued, has come to refer to works that have both succeeded as well\nas preceded Proust himself, students will be introduced to works by\nauthors who might have influenced Proust — such as: Baudelaire,\nBalzac, George Eliot, Thomas Hardy, John Ruskin and Ralph Waldo\nEmerson — as well as examples of writers who had been inspired\nby Proust’s work — such as: Virginia Woolf, Vladimir Nabokov, Javier\nMarias, Thomas Bernhard and W.G.

Creative and analytic close\nreading will be the primary tool of analysis\nENGL BC3246 WRITING THE MEDIEVAL SELF. 3.00 points.\nThe late Middle Ages and early Renaissance saw an explosion\nin the use of the ﬁrst-person singular \"I\" by European writers of\nnarrative texts. Although these narratives – among them dream\nvisions, philosophical allegories, spiritual autobiographies, and\nstraight-up novels – do not always correspond to modern ideas about\nautobiography, they nonetheless demonstrate a growing interest in\nsuch \"autobiographical\" topics as personal identity, sexual difference,\nmental illness, and disability, even as they experiment with a variety of\nliterary forms and raise fundamental questions about the relationship\nbetween truth and writing. Writers will include Augustine, Dante,\nBoccaccio, Chaucer, Christine de Pisan, Thomas Hoccleve, Julian of\nNorwich and Teresa de Cartagena, among others.

Tony\nTanner in his famous Adultery in the Novel characterizes marriage as\n“the structure which supports all structure.” Contemporary critics have\nseen marriage as essential to maintaining the “family values” of the\nbourgeoisie; feminists and Marxists have challenged the economic\nassumptions of patriarchally-deﬁned marriage. Folklorists have treated\nmarriage as the endpoint of the search for a safe domestic space.\nStarting in ancient times with classic fairy tales and the Hebrew Bible,\nmoving on to a famous medieval poem, a medieval memoir, and three\nnineteenth-century novels, we will encounter cultural expressions\nwhich address intimate partnerships with an emphasis on marriage as\na deﬁning condition\nFall 2024: ENGL BC3249\nCourse\nNumber\nSection/Call\nNumber\nTimes/Location Instructor Points Enrollment\nENGL 3249 001/00530 M 4:10pm - 6:00pm \n407 Barnard Hall\nDAPHNE\nMIRIAM\nMERKIN\n4.00 5/18\nENGL BC3250 INTRODUCTION TO US LATINX LITERATURE. 3.00 points.\nThis course introduces students to a growing body of work by Latina\nand Latino writers in the United States, and engages with the critical\ntools necessary for analyzing a ﬁeld of inquiry and practice that\ncontinues to reframe itself, right down to the label \"Latinx.\" What does\nthat name include, and what does it exclude, in cultural productions\nborn of conflicts of origin, language, race, gender, sexuality, and\nnationality? For some understanding of context, we will turn to the\nhistory and pressures of transnational migration, exile, assimilation,\nbilingualism and queerness as these variously affect the means and\nmodes of the literary productions with which we're concerned. At the\nsame time, the course will emphasize the invented and hybrid nature of\nLatinx literary and cultural traditions, and it will investigate the place of\nthose inventions in the larger framework of American intellectual and\nliterary traditions. Readings will be drawn from work written primarily in\nEnglish, but we will also consider graphic novels, Latinx performance,\nand works in translation\nENGL BC3251 NINETEENTH-CENTURY THRILLERS. 4.00 points.\nThis class will investigate the ways in which the nineteenth-century\nnovel is shaped by the forces of horror, sensation, suspense and the\nsupernatural. We will ask how the melodramatic imagination, the\nrhetoric of monstrosity, and the procedures of detection mark high\nnarrative realism with the signs of cultural anxieties building up around\nnineteenth-century revolution, industrialization, capitalism, bigamy,\nCatholicism and immigration. Looking at representative samples of\nthe Romantic neo-gothic novel, mid-century ghost stories, the highly\npopular and controversial sensation novels of the 1860’s along with\ntheir spectacular iterations on the Victorian stage, we will come away\nwith a deeper and more nuanced understanding of the intersection\nbetween the novel and popular entertainment. Readings will probably\ninclude Austen’s Northanger Abbey, Brontë’s Villette, Braddon’s Lady\nAudley’s Secret, Collins’s The Woman in White, Dickens’s Bleak House,\nStoker’s Dracula, plays by Boucicault, Hazelwood, Lewis, and Wood, and\nghost stories by Edwards, Gaskell, Hood, and Mulock\nSpring 2025: ENGL BC3251\nCourse\nNumber\nSection/Call\nNumber\nTimes/Location Instructor Points Enrollment\nENGL 3251 001/00184 W 2:10pm - 4:00pm \n214 Milbank Hall\nMonica Cohen 4.00 23/21\nENGL BC3252 CONTEMPORARY MEDIA THEORY. 4.00 points.\nSophomore standing required.

What inspires, or necessitates,\na writer to practice exophony: to migrate into “foreign” linguistic\nterritory? And in the case of bilingual or plurilingual writers, what\nfactors determine the language(s) chosen for creative expression, and\nwhat might cause that choice to shift over time? To what degree do\nexophonic writers create a third, hybrid language? And how might their\nworks underscore the mutability and instability of language itself?\nThis seminar will focus on a series of women who, either for political\nor personal reasons, have reshaped and revised their linguistic points\nof reference, radically questioning—and perhaps willfully subverting\n—notions of nationality, identity, linguistic normativity, and a “mother\ntongue”. Special attention will be paid to the reception of exophonic\nwriters, to feminist narratives of separation and self-fashioning, to\nmother-daughter dyads, to cases of self-translation, to colonialist and\npost-colonialist frameworks, and to how the phenomenon of exophony\nfurther complicates, but also enriches, the translator’s task. Readings\nwill combine literary texts with essays, interviews, and theoretical\nwritings by and about exophonic writers.

This course investigates the relationship between\nfascism and colonialism, during moment when we are experiencing\na global rise in right-wing authoritarian governments premised on\nanti-migrant politics. What is the relationship between fascism and\ncolonialism, and democracy, equality, and internationalism? What are\nthe class alliances behind fascism? What are institutions that facilitate\nit? In a spirit of internationalism, this class brings together classic\nanti-colonial and anti-fascists works under one umbrella. We will start\nby reading theoretical texts by Umberto Ecco, Toni Morrison, Susan\nSontag, G.M. Tamás, W.E.B. Du Bois, Gandhi, Tagore, Nancy Cunard,\nand George Padmore. Texts include: The Underdogs, Azuela’s novel of\nthe Mexican Revolution; Chestnutt’s The Marrow of Tradition; Family\nLexicon, Natalia Ginzburg’s memoir of Italian fascism; The Seventh\nCross, a thrilling novel about escaping a German concentration camp\nby Anne Seghers, who herself escaped through France; Arab writers\nEtel Adnan, Emile Habibi, and Ghassan Kanafani; My Tender Matador\nby Chilean queer/trans author Pedro Lemebel; Philadelphia Fire by\nJohn Edgar Wideman; Ministry of Utmost Happiness by Roy; and\nKureishi and Frears’s queer countercultural ﬁlm, Sammie and Rosie Get\nLaid\nENGL BC3297 UNSILENT VOICES: THE MEDIEVAL LYRIC IN EUROPE.\n3.00 points.\nFrom the fall of the Western Empire to the Protestant Reformation, a\nperiod of over 1000 years, poets in Europe produced an extraordinarily\nrich and varied body of lyric poetry that continues to exert a major\ninfluence on world literature today. While some of this poetry is\nreligious in nature, a great deal also addresses such diverse themes\nas desire, selfhood, politics, gender, and humanity’s relation to the non-\nhuman world. In this class we will examine medieval lyrics originally\ncomposed in a number of languages including but not limited to Old\nand Middle English, Latin, Occitan, Hebrew, Arabic, Italian, French,\nGerman and Portuguese.

Often called “confessional,” this poetry often does\nnot actually express the kind of guilty self-revelation such a term\nimplies. As the critic David Kalstone put it, “American poetry of this\nperiod became increasingly available to autobiographical energies of\nall sorts, not simply to writing which was desperate and on the edge.”\nThis course examines some of that poetry, and its non-confessional\nuse of an autobiographical “I.” We will explore how this poetry, far from\nrepresenting a rejection of tradition, drew on early modern work to\nimbue seemingly modern autobiographical effects with new quickness\nand life", "source": "pdfs/barnard 2024-2025.pdf"}

On a broader scale, this\ncourse aims to place Persian poetry and poetics within a world\nliterature discourse, both in terms of its historical contributions to this\ndiscourse as well as the discourse’s contributions to Persian poetics. It\nis meant to encourage you to investigate the role that translation plays\nin world literary studies; at the same time, it acknowledges the limits\nof global markets of literature and their politics of translation.

Sometimes\nthis is a transition that the heroine has desired; other times, alteration\nand transformation arise from sources mysterious and unknown, or\nas a result of the journey the story has brought them. This course\nexamines the element of change in a wide range of literature, from\nOvid to Maggie Nelson, from Shakespeare to Roxane Gay—but it\nalso provides an opportunity for students to consider the ways in\nwhich they, too have been changed—by joy, by trauma, by time. In\naddition to writing critically about the works we will read together,\nstudents will also write a personal essay about their experience of\nmetamorphosis; this essay will be examined in a modiﬁed workshop\nformat. At semester’s end, students will re-write and change that same\nessay, in hopes of seeing how revision on the page might provide a\nmodel for understanding the metamorphoses we experience as human\nbeings on this earth. Authors will likely include Ovid, Kafka, Robert\nLouis Stevenson, Borges, Shaun Tan, Roxane Gay, George Saunders,\nArthur C. Clarke, Shakespeare, and Maggie Nelson.

In this class, we will explore\nthe different ways in which feminists have used these modes to\ncreate visions of the self, to challenge the roles and self-images given\nto them, and to imagine new narratives. In particular, we'll explore\nquestions of genre: so many of these writers have developed hybrid\ngenres or challenged the boundaries of genre in order to write their\nlives. Looking at examples of life writing including letters, diaries and\njournals, graphic memoirs, and \"traditional\" autobiographies, we will\nexamine these forms through the lens of gender, race, sexuality, class,\nand disability. Readings are subject to change, but may include: Audre\nLorde, Zami; Alison Bechdel, Fun Home; Cherrie Moraga, Loving in the\nWar Years; Maggie Nelson, The Argonauts; Maxine Hong Kingston,\nWoman Warrior; poems by Adrienne Rich; Carmen Maria Machado,\nIn the Dream House; This Bridge Called My Back: Writings by Radical\nWomen of Color; Janet Mock, Redeﬁning Realness, and selected\nshorter pieces. Additionally, we will read critical and theoretical works\nthat will urge us to consider our primary texts from various critical\napproaches: including sexuality studies, critical race studies, disability\nstudies, and transgender studies", "source": "pdfs/barnard 2024-2025.pdf"}

We will also look at shifting interpretations of \"bad love,\"\nfrom Plato, to the Galenic theory of the humors, to the sociology of\ncourt-culture, to Freudian and ﬁnally contemporary neurobiological\nexplanations of feelings.

How have contraceptives, pharmaceuticals, and other\ntechnologies shaped reproductive experiences? What does the use\nand distribution of these scientiﬁc innovations reveal about existing\npower structures and social stratiﬁcation? What liberatory possibilities\ndo these technologies enable, and what are their limitations?

How can one's speciﬁc experience transcend the\nlimits of narrative and transmit a deeper meaning to any reader? How\ncan a writer transmit the wisdom gained from personal experience\nwithout lecturing her reader? In The Art of the Essay, we explore the\nanswers to these questions by reading personal essays in a variety of\ndifferent forms. We begin with Michel de Montaigne, the 16th-century\nphilosopher who popularized the personal essay as we know it and\nfamously asked, “What do I know?,” and follow the development of\nthe form as a locus of rigorous self-examination, doubt, persuasion,\nand provocation. Through close reading of a range of essays from\nwriters including Annie Dillard, George Orwell, Jamaica Kincaid, and\nJune Jordan, we analyze how voice, form, and evidence work together\nto create a world of meaning around an author's experience, one that\ninvites readers into conversations that are at once deeply personal and\nuniversal in their consequences and implications\nENGL BC3307 THE 'GLOBAL' NOVEL. 3.00 points.\n“Yes, globalization can produce homogeneity, but globalization is also\na threat to homogeneity.” — Kwame Anthony Appiah, “The Case for\nContamination,” New York Times Magazine, 2006. Thinking through\nthe arguments both in favor of and against globalization, particularly\nin the realm of cultural productions, in this course we will discuss\nthe “global” novel. To that end, using the introductory essay from The\nGlobal Novel: Writing the World in the 21st Century as a starting point\nto discuss ﬁve novels from across the globe, we’ll investigate what\nis meant by “global” and what the criteria for including novels in this\ncategorization are. We will also consider whether there is an erasure\nof cultural difference and nuance in reading novels using a globalizing\nperspective in order to render them more approachable for a (primarily)\nUS audience. In order to think through and challenge this category of\nthe global, we will also read novels that can be roughly categorized as\npostcolonial. We will thus consider how struggles for independence\nand the desire to locate one’s identity either within freshly liberated\nnation-states or in the process of immigrating to former metropoles\ncould give rise to cultural and psychological anxieties. We will also\nconsider the manner in which late-stage capitalism could indeed push\ntoward homogenized senses of self that manifest in a category such\nas the “global novel” and whether arguments could be made in favor\nof such homogenization. Ultimately, we will think about the politics of\nglobalization and the desire to include in or exclude from the “global”\ncertain locations, cultural products, or peoples\nENGL BC3308 QUEER GENRES. 3.00 points.\nIn this class, we will focus on queer narratives of the self to explore\nhow authors represent queerness across centuries and genres, and\nhow these queer narratives are informed by various historical, national,\ncultural and political contexts. Through a comparative, transnational\nand intersectional approach that takes into account the particularities\nof each author’s context, we will aim to answer the following questions:\nHow do various cultural, national, linguistic, religious or political\ncontexts affect the way queer identities are deﬁned and represented\nin literature? How do these authors represent the intersections of\nqueerness with race, class, ethnicity, disability and citizenship? How\nhave queer narratives developed over time and across cultures in\nconversation with local and global modes of conceptualizing gender\nand sexuality? How do queer authors utilize the particularities of\neach genre to create new forms of self-expression? Texts will span\nvarious genres such as short stories, poems, memoirs, graphic novels,\nnovels and personal essays by authors such as James Baldwin, Audre\nLorde, Sappho, Carmen Maria Machado, Alison Bechdel, Adrienne\nRich, Casey Plett and Imogen Binnie. Additionally, we will read critical\nand theoretical works that will urge us to consider these works from\na range of perspectives, such as queer studies, feminist studies,\ndisability studies, and transgender studies", "source": "pdfs/barnard 2024-2025.pdf"}

Renaissance London gave\nbirth to a booming theatrical world, with plays that reflected the diverse\nurban life of the city, as well as the layered and often contradictory\ninner life of the individual. This poetically rich theater was less\nconcerned with presenting answers, and more with staging questions\n—about gender, religion, power, love, sex, authority, class, violence, and\nmore. We will encounter these questions in works by Shakespeare and\nother major authors who populated this literary scene: Ben Jonson,\nThomas Dekker, Thomas Middleton, John Webster, the ever-popular\n“Anonymous,” and others. Putting them in dialogue with their social\nworld, and situating them within a culture of performance, we will\nengage with the plays via detailed close reading and literary analysis\nCross-Listed Courses\nCPLT BC3204 Literary Worldmaking: Two Case Studies. 4.00 points.\nThis seminar engages students in the immersive and intensive reading\nof two masterworks of modern prose ﬁction: Middlemarch, published\nby George Eliot (the pseudonym of Mary Ann Evans) in 1871-2 in\nEngland, and The Story of the Stone, or the Dream of the Red Chamber,\ncomposed by Cao Xueqin (and continued by Gao E) in the late 18th-\ncentury moment of Qing-dynasty China. While using devices and\nconventions from different narrative traditions, these novels operate in\nthe mode of realism and do so at a monumental and panoramic scale,\ncreating literary worlds that reflect the realia of historical lifeworlds.\nBeyond representing aspects of empirically recognizable worlds,\nthese novels also incorporate philosophical reflection on their own\nmeans of representation, on their very status as ﬁction, on the power\nand limits of imaginative worldmaking. By studying these novels\nas cases of literary worldmaking, we will take the opportunity also\nto reflect critically in this class on the world that emerges–and the\nprocess of worldmaking that gets activated–in our very experience of\nstudying these texts together. We will consider how cosmopolitanism,\nas a guiding ideal of the Enlightenment and post-Enlightenment\nuniversity, may be renewed by literary study to help us inhabit a world\nof common humanity that is richer and more complex than is evident in\nparticularist localisms or a satellite-view, techno-economic globalism.\nMiddlemarch we will read in its entirety. For the sake of time, we will\nread, in David Hawkes’ translation, the 80-chapter version of The Story\nof the Stone, or the Dream of the Red Chamber, attributed to Cao\nXueqin, instead of the 120-chapter version, with the last 40 chapters\nattributed to Gao E.

We derive much of our\ninformation about the world from visual media. Social networks,\ntelevision, cinema: all shape our aesthetic sensibilities and our political\nvisions. Yet we often lack a basic understanding of what could be\ncalled “visual literacy.” This introductory course gives students the\ncritical tools to analyze how ﬁlm and other visual media really work –\nin order to appreciate their artistic and social achievements, as well as\nto guard against their insidious manipulative devices. In the ﬁrst part\nof the semester, we focus on ﬁlm analysis through a detailed study of\nthe different production phases of ﬁlmmaking – from screenwriting\nand mise-en-scène to editing and ﬁlm scoring. We pay special attention\nto the way in which certain stylistic and narrative choices have\nparticular ideological effects. The second part of the course looks\nat ﬁlm history through a comprehensive, chronological overview of\nits main movements and periods, including the coming of sound in\nHollywood cinema, post-war Italian Neorealism, the emergence of\nworld auteurs, New Waves of the 1960s and 1970s, etc. Students will\nuse the hermeneutical tools learnt in ﬁlm analysis to intellectually\nengage with some masterworks of ﬁlm history. In the third and ﬁnal\npart of the semester, we study the major debates of ﬁlm theory from\nperspectives such as auteurism, formalism, psychoanalysis, Marxism,\nfeminism, postcolonial and queer studies, etc. Required screenings\ninclude Nanook of the North (Flaherty, 1922), Sunrise (Murnau,\n1927), Man with a Movie Camera (Vertov, 1929), Casablanca (Curtiz,\n1942), Bicycle Thieves (De Sica, 1948), Rashomon (Kurosawa, 1950),\nBreathless (Godard, 1960), Belle de Jour (Buñuel, 1967), The Hour of\nthe Furnaces (Solanas, 1968), Seven Beauties (Wertmüller, 1974), Blue\nVelvet (Lynch, 1986), Paris Is Burning (Livingstone, 1990), and Children\nof Men (Cuarón, 2006)\nFall 2024: FILM BC3201\nCourse\nNumber\nSection/Call\nNumber\nTimes/Location Instructor Points Enrollment\nFILM 3201 001/00031 F 2:10pm - 5:30pm \n405 Milbank Hall\nJason\nLaRiviere\n3.00 42/90\nTHTR UN3150 CRITICAL HISTORIES OF DRAMA, THEATRE, AND\nPERFORMANCE I. 4.00 points.\nThis course undertakes a dialectical approach to reading and thinking\nabout the history of dramatic theatre, interrogating the ways writing\ninflects, and is inflected by, the material dynamics of performance.\nCourse undertakes careful study of the practices of performance,\nand of the sociocultural, economic, political, and aesthetic conditions\nanimating representative performance in “classical” theatres globally;\ncourse will also emphasize development of important critical concepts\nfor the analysis of drama, theatre, and performance.

Calculus, Physics, and a second year of Chemistry are\nrecommended for students planning graduate study in Environmental\nBiology. \nStudents interested in Environmental Biology often choose to spend\na semester \"abroad\", at the School for Field Studies program, the\nOrganization for Tropical Studies, or at comparable programs offered\nby other institutions. We encourage students to take advantage of such\nopportunities, and we expect that most of the courses they complete\nin these programs will be accepted in lieu of some of the major\nrequirements. In addition, we recommend that those students planning\nto go abroad in the junior year elect to do so in the Fall Semester rather\nthan the Spring Semester in order to take best advantage of senior\nseminar research planning and programming.\nStudents who elect a major in Environmental Biology will have a major\nadviser in each department. Although one member of the faculty\nwill serve as the primary adviser, requests to substitute courses\nfrom Columbia or other institutions must be approved by both major\nadvisers. \nInternships or some type of work or ﬁeld experience are extremely\nvaluable in preparing students for careers in the environment. Go to\nthe Environmental Science website for Opportunities & Afﬁliations for\nlistings or see Beyond Barnard. Studies have shown that students who\nhave had related work experience are more attractive to employers and\ngraduate schools.\nStudents should check the catalogue and the department for additional\ninformation on the major and courses offered by Barnard and\nColumbia. Classes with grades less than C- or taken pass/fail can not\nbe counted towards the major.  The minimum number of course points\nfor the Environmental Biology Major is 51.5 points.\nSee also Senior Research Seminar for information on senior thesis\nrequirements completed in Environmental Science Department.\nCross-Listed Courses\nBiological Sciences (Barnard)\nBIOL BC1500 INTRO ORGANISMAL/EVOL BIOL. 3.00 points.\nPrerequisites: BIOL BC1001 or equivalent preparation.

High academic standards, multidisciplinary courses, and\ntraining in methodologies such as ﬁeld work, measurements, and data\nanalysis, ready our students with the tools needed to think critically,\nevaluate and solve problems, and understand and communicate\nscience to address the needs of society. Faculty members are\nnationally and internationally recognized scholars and educators,\nactive in research and curriculum development. Courses are innovative,\nfeaturing multimedia and technologically advanced resources. The\nurban setting, the proximity to the Hudson River, and the numerous\nafﬁliations we maintain with Columbia University through Lamont#\nDoherty Earth Observatory, the Earth Institute, and the School of\nPublic Health, as well as Black Rock Forest, the American Museum of\nNatural History and other institutions, allow us to offer undergraduates\nunparalleled opportunities for student research and educational\nexperiences. Upon successful completion of our program, our students\nare well prepared to continue their academic studies as graduate\nstudents or to pursue successful careers in a wide range of ﬁelds.\nStudent Learning Outcomes\nWe expect that students graduating with an environmental major will\nlearn to:\n• recognize the history, structure, function, interactions, and trends of\nkey environmental systems: climate, earth, life, socio#political;\n• assemble a logical chain of reasoning ranging from observation\nto inference and action, not only to identify and characterize a\nproblem, but also to ﬁnd solutions:\n• design an independent scientiﬁc inquiry, from methods to\ninterpretation;\n• locate, organize, analyze, integrate, synthesize, and evaluate\ncomplex information from multiple and disparate sources;\n• apply appropriate analytical and quantitative approaches:\n• organize, visualize, and statistically analyze environmental\ndata, and interpret relationships, trends and make predictions\nabout future changes;\n• handle uncertain, complex, real-world problems in the lab, ﬁeld,\ncommunity, and workplace:\n• observe analytically and integrate diverse information from\nvariable sources outside of the classroom;\n• think critically, creatively, resourcefully, and strategically,\nincluding identifying steps needed to reach goals, manage\nprojects, evaluate progress, and adapt approaches, developing\nboth self reliance, and civic#mindedness;\n• develop spatial literacy, understand the role of maps and 2-3\ndimensional spatial systems; effectively process, reason,\nproblem solve and communicate issues within a spacial\ncontext;\n• utilize advances in environmental sciences and technology to\nresolve issues and anticipate implications;\n• clearly communicate complex analyses, interpretations and\nsigniﬁcance through variable media (oral presentation, poster,\nproposal, research article, report), to audiences ranging from\nscientiﬁc to policy, and the general public;\n• collaborate in teams, with peers and mentors, and work with others\nin diverse group settings, developing flexibility and leadership\nskills.\nEnvironmental Science provides a scientiﬁc basis for management\nof earth systems. It focuses on the interaction between human\nactivities, resources, and the environment. As human population\ngrows and technology advances, pressures on earth's natural systems\nare becoming increasingly intense and complex. Environmental\nScience is an exciting ﬁeld where science is used to best serve\nsociety. The department offers two majors, Environmental Science and\nEnvironmental Policy. A third major, Environmental Biology, is offered in\nconjunction with the Department of Biological Sciences.\nThe curriculum recognizes the need for well-trained scientists to cope\nwith balancing human requirements and environmental conservation.\nMajors acquire an understanding of earth systems by taking courses\nin the natural sciences, as well as courses investigating environmental\nstress. Students learn to critically evaluate the diverse information\nnecessary for sound environmental analysis. Our courses foster an\ninterdisciplinary approach to environmental problem-solving.\nInternships or some type of work or ﬁeld experience are extremely\nvaluable in preparing students for a career in Environmental Science.\nWe strongly encourage students to consider an internship in the\nsummer before the senior year because it may lay the foundation for\nthe senior thesis.  Studies have shown that students who have had\nrelated work experience are more attractive to employers and graduate\nschools.\nStudents interested in environmental science might want to consider\na semester or summer program at the SEE-U, SEA Semester at Woods\nHole, the School for Field Studies, the Organization for Tropical Studies,\nor some other ﬁeld program.  In addition, we recommend that those\nstudents planning to go abroad in the junior year elect to do so in the", "source": "pdfs/barnard 2024-2025.pdf"}

The trajectory of the major moves from\nintroductory level courses (primarily surveys) to intermediate level\ncourses (that introduce the mechanics of writing for ﬁlm as well as ﬁlm\nmaking), to advanced level courses (including two labs and the senior\nseminar), plus two electives from the approved list. While the course\nof study is rooted in ﬁlm history and theory, all majors take workshops\nin screenwriting and ﬁlmmaking and produce a script and a short ﬁlm.\nOur place in a premier college for women invites our Program to pay\nspecial attention to questions of gender, and our home in New York City\nallows students to connect their study to the city’s vibrant ﬁlm industry\nas well as range of ﬁlm in arts houses and revival theaters.\nStudent Learning Outcomes\nStudents who graduate in Film Studies will be able to attain the\nfollowing outcomes:\n• Demonstrate in-depth knowledge of ﬁlm history;\n• Explain the major concepts or ideas of ﬁlm theory;\n• Communicate in-depth knowledge of ﬁlm in one other language\ntradition;\n• Write a basic/elementary screenplay;\n• Create a short ﬁlm;\n• Demonstrate an understanding of ﬁlm’s relationship to a range of\nother disciplines across the humanities and social sciences;\n• Conduct original research on a ﬁlm (usually one ﬁlm) intensively in\nthe context of a limited enrollment senior seminar.\nFor questions about Film Studies contact Ross Hamilton\n(rhamilto@barnard.edu), Professor of English.\nAdvising Resources\n All Film Studies majors are advised by Ross Hamilton\n(rhamilto@barnard.edu).\nGuidance for First-Year Students\nThe Requirements (p. 300) section on the Catalogue provides a\nuseful guide for courses to take.\nEnrolling In Courses \nThere are no special restrictions for registering for Film Studies\ncourses.\nCourses taken outside Barnard\nAdvanced Placement Credit\nFor information about advanced placement in Film Studies, please\nvisit this website.

We derive much of our\ninformation about the world from visual media. Social networks,\ntelevision, cinema: all shape our aesthetic sensibilities and our political\nvisions. Yet we often lack a basic understanding of what could be\ncalled “visual literacy.” This introductory course gives students the\ncritical tools to analyze how ﬁlm and other visual media really work –\nin order to appreciate their artistic and social achievements, as well as\nto guard against their insidious manipulative devices. In the ﬁrst part\nof the semester, we focus on ﬁlm analysis through a detailed study of\nthe different production phases of ﬁlmmaking – from screenwriting\nand mise-en-scène to editing and ﬁlm scoring. We pay special attention\nto the way in which certain stylistic and narrative choices have\nparticular ideological effects. The second part of the course looks\nat ﬁlm history through a comprehensive, chronological overview of\nits main movements and periods, including the coming of sound in\nHollywood cinema, post-war Italian Neorealism, the emergence of\nworld auteurs, New Waves of the 1960s and 1970s, etc. Students will\nuse the hermeneutical tools learnt in ﬁlm analysis to intellectually\nengage with some masterworks of ﬁlm history. In the third and ﬁnal\npart of the semester, we study the major debates of ﬁlm theory from\nperspectives such as auteurism, formalism, psychoanalysis, Marxism,\nfeminism, postcolonial and queer studies, etc. Required screenings\ninclude Nanook of the North (Flaherty, 1922), Sunrise (Murnau,\n1927), Man with a Movie Camera (Vertov, 1929), Casablanca (Curtiz,\n1942), Bicycle Thieves (De Sica, 1948), Rashomon (Kurosawa, 1950),\nBreathless (Godard, 1960), Belle de Jour (Buñuel, 1967), The Hour of\nthe Furnaces (Solanas, 1968), Seven Beauties (Wertmüller, 1974), Blue\nVelvet (Lynch, 1986), Paris Is Burning (Livingstone, 1990), and Children\nof Men (Cuarón, 2006)\nFall 2024: FILM BC3201\nCourse\nNumber\nSection/Call\nNumber\nTimes/Location Instructor Points Enrollment\nFILM 3201 001/00031 F 2:10pm - 5:30pm \n405 Milbank Hall\nJason\nLaRiviere\n3.00 42/90\nFILM BC3204 Discussion Section. 0 points.\nEnrollment in one of the following sections is required when registering\nfor FILM BC 3201: Introduction to Film and Film Theory.", "source": "pdfs/barnard 2024-2025.pdf"}

Some ﬁlm scholars seem\nconfused when the term “Independent Cinema” is used in academic\ndiscussions. “Independent of what?” and “How independent really?”\nimmediately come up as questions to dismiss the term as too general\nand misleading. Yet Independent Cinema is not a vague concept:\nquite the contrary, it very speciﬁcally designates the terrain where\none of the most controversial debates in America’s ﬁlm history has\ntaken place. In this course, we study 1) the most important alternative\nﬁlm practices in the US during the 1980s and 1990s, assessing their\npolitical and aesthetic accomplishments, and 2) the way “Indie” Cinema\nwas simultaneously incorporated, neutralized, and/or neglected by\nmainstream media conglomerates. For that purpose, we ﬁrst focus on\nthe development of non-standard modes of production in the 1940s\nand 1950s – as exempliﬁed in some works by Maya Deren, Kenneth\nAnger, and John Cassavetes – as well as Hollywood’s commercial\nstrategies to renew its hegemony from the 1960s onwards – we take\nDennis Hopper’s Easy Rider (1969) as a case study. We then turn to the\nanalysis of “minor” American cinemas, their forms of thinking, and their\nimpact in public debates concerning freedom of speech, civil rights,\nand the representation of minorities in the screen during the 1980s.\nIn the last part of the semester, we examine the commodiﬁcation of\nindependent ﬁlmmaking in the 1990s (Disney’s takeover of Miramax,\ncooptation of the Sundance Film Festival, etc) to further understand\nthat subtle division between art and commercialism in recent American\ncinema. In-class screenings include Eraserhead (David Lynch, 1977),\nChan Is Missing (Wayne Wang, 1982), Down by Law (Jim Jarmusch,\n1986), Do the Right Thing (Spike Lee, 1989), sex, lies, and videotape\n(Steven Soderbergh, 1989), American Dream (Barbara Kopple, 1990),\nReservoir Dogs (Quentin Tarantino, 1992), and Inside Llewyn Davis\n(Coen brothers, 2013)\nFILM BC3245 American Television Drama. 3 points.\nBetween prestige and streaming, the medium of television has never\ncovered a wider breadth of narratives, voices, and concerns.

In this course, we focus on ﬁve outstanding\nadaptations written and directed by French auteurs François Truffaut\nand Éric Rohmer during the 1970s: The Wild Child (1970), Two English\nGirls (1971), The Story of Adèle H. (1975), The Marquise of O... (1976),\nand Perceval (1978). By carefully examining the literary texts and their\ntranspositions to the screen, we study the speciﬁc qualities of ﬁlm\nadaptations and discuss seminal ideas on originality, authorship, and\nhybridization in the arts. We start by reading three “classical” essays\non ﬁlm and literature –Sergei Eisenstein’s “Dickens, Grifﬁth, and the\nFilm Today” (1944), André Bazin’s “For an Impure Cinema: In Defense\nof Adaptation” (1952), and George Bluestone’s “The Limits of the Novel\nand the Limits of the Film” (1957)– in order to recognize the afﬁnities\nand differences between “the concept of the mental image” in literature\nand “the percept of the visual image” in cinema. We then pay attention\nto the different methods used by Truffaut and Rohmer to translate the\noriginal texts to the screen. For that purpose, before watching each\nﬁlm, we closely read its “source”: a medieval romance (Chrétien de\nTroyes’ Perceval, the Story of the Grail, 1191), a medical report (Jean\nItard’s The Education of a Savage Man, 1798), a Romantic novella\n(Heinrich von Kleist’s The Marquise of O..., 1808), a secret diary (Adèle\nHugo’s Journal of Exile, 1866), and a semi-autobiographical novel\n(Henri-Pierre Roché’s Two English Girls and the Continent, 1952). Each\nreading is followed by an in-depth analysis of Truffaut’s and Rohmer’s\nﬁlms, with emphasis on the signiﬁcant changes in narrative structure,\npoint of view, and characterization – which, in turn, allow for audio-\nvisual patterning appropriate to ﬁlm. The study of the directors’ styles\n(camera movement, lighting techniques, use of sound and music,\nmontage, etc) will enable us to verify to what extent the serious ﬁlm\nadaptor becomes a creator in his own right\nFILM BC3301 Advanced Production. 3 points.\nPrerequisites: FILM BC3201 or equivalent.

Some key concepts in Benedict Anderson’s\nbook \"Imagined Communities\" will help us to understand why “national\nidentities” played such a primordial role among Latin American ﬁlm\nintellectuals in the 1960s and 1970s. Special attention will be paid to\nthe manifestos written by Julio García Espinosa, Fernando Solanas,\nand Octavio Getino, and to how they confronted Hollywood’s hegemony\nin order to create an auteurist ﬁlm tradition in the region. In the second\npart of the seminar, we will study the global success of the Latin\nAmerican cinemas of the 2000s from a transnational perspective:\nfeatures such as Alfonso Cuarón’s \"Y tu mamá también\" (2001),\nLucrecia Martel’s \"The Swamp\" (2001), and Fernando Meirelles and\nKátia Lund’s \"City of God\" (2002) will be examined in relation to the\npolitical and aesthetic traditions discussed in part one. We will explore\nhow these contemporary Latin American ﬁlmmakers have shifted their\ninterests from national identities to questions of gender, race, class,\nand sexuality. The critical interpretation of these ﬁlms will allow us to\nredeﬁne the idea of \"national cinemas\" and to reexamine the historical\ntensions between state control, commercialism, and independent\ncinema in Latin America", "source": "pdfs/barnard 2024-2025.pdf"}

By accepting Hollywood’s narrative model as\ncentral, ﬁlm scholars have often relegated non-male, non-white, non-\nWestern ﬁlms to a secondary role. Often described as “marginal”\nor “peripheral” cinemas, the outcomes of these ﬁlm practices have\nbeen systematically excluded from the canon. Yet… are these motion\npictures really “secondary”? In relation to what? And according to\nwhom? This course looks at major ﬁlms by women ﬁlmmakers of\nthe 20th Century within a tradition of political cinema that 1) directly\nconfronts the hegemonic masculinity of the Hollywood ﬁlm industry,\nand 2) relocates the so-called “alternative women’s cinema” at\nthe core of ﬁlm history. Unlike conventional feminist ﬁlm courses,\nwhich tend to be contemporary and anglocentric, this class adopts a\nhistorical and worldwide perspective; rather than focusing on female\ndirectors working in America today, we trace the origins of women’s\ncinema in different cities of the world (Berlin, Paris, New York) during\nthe silent period, and, from there, we move forward to study major\nworks by international radical directors such as Lorenza Mazzetti,\nAgnès Varda, Forough Farrokhzad, Věra Chytilová, Chantal Akerman,\nLiliana Cavani, Barbara Kopple, Larisa Shepitko, and Mira Nair. We\nanalyse how these ﬁlmmakers have explored womanhood not only\nas a source of oppresion (critique of patriarchal phallocentrism,\nchallenge to heteronormativity, etc) but, most importantly, as a source\nof empowerment (defense of matriarchy, equal rights, lesbian love,\ninter- and transexuality...). Required readings include seminal texts of\nfeminist ﬁlm theory by Claire Johnston, Laura Mulvey, Ann Kaplan, bell\nhooks, and Judith Butler. Among the ﬁlms screened in the classroom\nare: silent movies –\"Suspense\" (Lois Weber, 1913), \"The Smiling\nMadame Beudet\" (Germaine Dulac, 1922)—, early independent and\nexperimental cinema –\"Girls in Uniform\" (Leontine Sagan, 1931),\n\"Ritual in Transﬁgured Time\" (Maya Deren, 1946)—, “new wave” ﬁlms\nof the 1950s and 1960s –\"Together\" (Mazzetti, 1956), \"Cléo from 5 to\n7\" (Varda, 1962), \"Daisies\" (Chytilová, 1966)–, auteur cinema of the\n1970s – \"Jeanne Dielman\" (Akerman, 1975), \"The Ascent\" (Shepitko,\n1977)–, and documentary ﬁlms –\"Harlan County, USA\" (Kopple, 1976),\n\"Paris Is Burning\" (Jennie Livingston, 1990)\nSpring 2025: FILM BC3702\nCourse\nNumber\nSection/Call\nNumber\nTimes/Location Instructor Points Enrollment\nFILM 3702 001/00196 F 4:10pm - 7:55pm \n328 Milbank Hall\nSophia de\nBaun\n4.00 14/18\nCross-Listed Courses\nAnthropology (Barnard)\nANTH V3824 Fantasy, Film, and Fiction in Archaeology. 4 points.\nBC: Fulﬁllment of General Education Requirement: Cultures in\nComparison (CUL). \nNot offered during 2023-2024 academic year.\nANTH W4625 Anthropology and Film. 3 points.\nBC: Fulﬁllment of General Education Requirement: Social Analysis\n(SOC I)., BC: Fulﬁllment of General Education Requirement: Cultures in\nComparison (CUL)., BC: Fulﬁllment of General Education Requirement:\nThe Visual and Performing Arts (ART). \nNot offered during 2023-2024 academic year.\nClassics (Barnard)\nCLLT V3230 Classics and Film. 3 points.\nBC: Fulﬁllment of General Education Requirement: The Visual and\nPerforming Arts (ART). \nConsiders cinematic representations of the ancient Mediterranean\nworld, from early silent ﬁlm to movies from the present day.

For them, and for many of\ntheir contemporaries, the central feature of the modern world was\nits ceaseless change. Under the pressure of political, scientiﬁc, and\neconomic revolutions, traditional ways of living and thinking might\ndisappear almost overnight, to be replaced not by a new order but\ninstead with an unending experience of instability and dislocation. This\ncourse reads a set of writers who both respond to and participate in\nthat process of constant transformation – in what we have learned\nto call modernity. Should culture try to protect timeless values from\nthe shock effects of modernization? Or should it ﬁnd, in change, an\nopportunity for new forms of life and new styles of expression? If –\nas Marx and Engels did – we imagine modernity as a distinctively\nEuropean event, how might writers outside of Europe make use of and\nrespond to a modernity that excludes them?

How do encounters with dominant discourses\nnecessitate acts of self-translation or resistance to translation,\nespecially for people of color, immigrants or queer communities? How\ndo narratives (both ﬁctional and personal) change when translated\nacross cultures and time to ﬁt with local discourses? What is the role\nof the translator in these acts of remaking? Drawing on postcolonial\nand translation theory, we will consider how writers have pushed back\nagainst dominant narratives through texts that cross and complicate\nlinguistic, cultural and national borders. Readings are subject to\nchange but will likely include a selection from following: literary texts\nby James Baldwin, Sappho, Marjane Satrapi, Ocean Vuong, Fatimah\nAsghar, Irena Klepﬁsz, as well as various English translations of the\n1001 Nights; and scholarly texts by Gloria Anzaldúa, Edward Said, bell\nhooks, Friedrich Schleiermacher and Jorge Luis Borges.

Description and interpretation of nature has shaped artistic\nrepresentation from the very beginning of human history, and we\nwill read both texts and images from the Americas in relation to\nselected European texts: from Crevecoeur’s “Letters from an American\nFarmer” (1765) to excerpts from Wordsworth’s “Prelude” in England\n(1798), which in turn influenced Emerson’s essay “Nature” (1836)\nand Thoreau’s writing in Walden and “Civil Disobedience” (1851). We\nwill also consider both texts and contexts from John Steinbeck’s The\nGrapes of Wrath (1939); Rachel Carson’s Silent Spring (1962); John\nMcPhee’s Encounters with the Archdruid (1971); and international\nreports and organizations including the International Panel on Climate\nChange (IPCC) and COP28. Engaging with activist organizations, we\nwill both write and analyze the impact of contemporary environmental\njournalism such as Bill McKibben’s The End of Nature, Liz Kolbert’s The\nSixth Extinction, and Alexis Pauline Gumbs, Undrowned: Black Feminist\nLessons from Marine Mammals\nFYWB BC1124 HAUNTED AMERICAS. 3.00 points.\nIn this course, we will encounter ghosts and hauntings in literature\nfrom the Americas, primarily from Latin American and Caribbean\nwriters. These ghosts expose something hidden in the past and pull\ndark secrets into the light. We will think about haunting not just as a\nsupernatural experience, but as a mechanism that reveals layers of\nhistory and unearths long buried injustices. A few of the characters we\nwill meet are: A Cuban exile living in Miami who is haunted by the life\nhe left behind; a teenager in Argentina who explores her queer identity\nand confronts the ghosts of the state violence; a General accused of\ngenocide who defends his innocence, though the ghosts in his home\nsay otherwise.

Wells’ classic novella The Time Machine and place its portrayal of\nthe future in the context of late Victorian science and socioeconomics.\nFinally, we will consider how contemporary literature reflects and\nresponds to the accelerating climate crisis, and explore ﬁction’s role in\nhelping us apprehend the potential for radical environmental disruption\nFall 2024: FYWB BC1126\nCourse\nNumber\nSection/Call\nNumber\nTimes/Location Instructor Points Enrollment\nFYWB 1126 001/00203 M W 4:10pm - 5:25pm \n403 Barnard Hall\nMichael\nShelichach\n3.00 16/15\nFYWB 1126 002/00204 M W 6:10pm - 7:25pm \n406 Barnard Hall\nMichael\nShelichach\n3.00 13/15\nSpring 2025: FYWB BC1126\nCourse\nNumber\nSection/Call\nNumber\nTimes/Location Instructor Points Enrollment\nFYWB 1126 001/00204 M W 6:10pm - 7:25pm \n404 Barnard Hall\nMichael\nShelichach\n3.00 15/15\nFYWB BC1128 MUSIC IN NARRATIVE. 3.00 points.\nHow and to what ends does literature represent musical form or\nthe feeling of musical encounter? In this course, we will discuss\nnarratives in which music plays a signiﬁcant role, whether through\nmusical allusion or its sustained thematic presence, or through\nprinciples of musical composition and gesture that play in the\nbackground, informing a text’s structural flow. We will consider\ncomplex resonances between literary narratives and histories of\nmusic culture and aesthetics, asking how writers use music to world-\nbuild, to characterize, and to situate a text culturally and politically.\nThroughout the semester, we will pay particular attention to narratives\nthat showcase the musical lives of characters belonging to historically\nmarginalized groups. In doing so, we will question how race, gender,\nand sexuality intersect with musical histories of aesthetic power.\nLiterary readings may include works by Jane Austen, James Baldwin,\nToni Morrison, and James Joyce. Secondary readings in performance\nstudies and musical aesthetics may include selections by Jennifer\nLynn Stoever, Judith Butler, Immanuel Kant, Arthur Schopenhauer,\nMaria Edgeworth, and others\nFall 2024: FYWB BC1128\nCourse\nNumber\nSection/Call\nNumber\nTimes/Location Instructor Points Enrollment\nFYWB 1128 001/00205 M W 11:40am - 12:55pm \n318 Milbank Hall\nElizabeth\nWeybright\n3.00 15/15\nSpring 2025: FYWB BC1128\nCourse\nNumber\nSection/Call\nNumber\nTimes/Location Instructor Points Enrollment\nFYWB 1128 001/00205 T Th 11:40am - 12:55pm \n404 Barnard Hall\nElizabeth\nWeybright\n3.00 15/15\nFYWB 1128 002/00206 T Th 1:10pm - 2:25pm \n405 Barnard Hall\nElizabeth\nWeybright\n3.00 14/15\nFYWB BC1129 SPECULATING THE PAST. 3.00 points.\nRecent works as diverse as The New York Times’s Overlooked Project\nand Netflix’s Bridgerton raise questions about what records we keep,\nhow we narrate history, and the factors that determine what stories we\ncan tell. In this class, we will probe these questions by reading literary\nworks that turn to a speculative mode to make sense of history, past\nand present. As we enter the critical conversation about the historical\nrecord, we will explore how authority and value are assigned to different\ntexts and accounts. In so doing, we will also develop our ability to read\ntexts' and documents' own theorizations of truth and fact. Readings\nmay include work by Virginia Woolf, Marlene NourbeSe Philip, Carmen\nMaria Machado, Adrienne Rich, and N.K.

Our literary and critical texts demand\nattention to the ways in which power shapes narrative, and narrative\nshapes power. We will think especially about how the oppressed, the\ncolonized, the exploited, speak to and against erasure; and also how\nthe marginalized create community by talking and talking back. The\nreadings include literary works by Nella Larsen, Jamaica Kincaid, Toni\nMorrison, and Layli Long Soldier; and critical works by Frantz Fanon,\nJudith Butler, bell hooks, and others.

It\nmeans concentration and deliberation. It can also mean distraction\nand confusion. Quietly reading a difﬁcult work of literature, puzzling\nover a math problem, revising a paper for class, or cooking an elaborate\nmeal are forms of attention. So is endlessly scrolling through social\nmedia, binge-watching a television series, or strolling aimlessly\nthrough the city. Where and how we use our attention is the foundation,\nthe bedrock, of nearly everything we think and do. It is therefore\nunsurprising that gathering and directing our attention is also an\nenormous, lucrative industry. In this course we will study the science\nand philosophy of attention alongside the history of the \"attention\neconomy\" and evolving techniques and technologies of attention\nharvesting. We will explore these subjects while reflecting upon and\nwriting about our own habits of paying attention. By paying attention\nto attention, we will nurture a brighter awareness of the many interests\nvying for our time, mental engagement, money, our very lives, and of our\nabilities to scrutinize, critically examine, or resist our entrapment within\nthe modern attention industry\nFall 2024: FYWB BC1132\nCourse\nNumber\nSection/Call\nNumber\nTimes/Location Instructor Points Enrollment\nFYWB 1132 001/00206 T Th 10:10am - 11:25am \n403 Barnard Hall\nNathan\nGorelick\n3.00 15/15\nFYWB 1132 002/00207 T Th 11:40am - 12:55pm \n403 Barnard Hall\nNathan\nGorelick\n3.00 15/15\nFYWB BC1135 CONTESTED TRUTHS: MEMORY, AUTHORITY AND\nHISTORY. 3.00 points.\nThis class examines the ways that a historical event can be\nremembered and described differently by direct participants, and how\npersonal biases, such as race, gender and class, affect the process\nof recollection and narration.

We will think about how capitalism,\ncolonialism, and white supremacy limit our imaginations, and how we\ncan think in ways that remake our world. Students will read essays by\nRuth Wilson Gilmore, Pheng Cheah, Denise F.

How have different writers mapped the\nliminal territory of the teenage experience? In this class, we will step\naway from the rich tradition of realistic Coming-of-Age narratives and\nexplore how genre frameworks—including speculative, horror, fairy tale,\ngothic, and quest traditions—have been used to illuminate the Teenage\nStrange. How have writers used the strangeness of genre to render\nthis slice of time? How does genre capture the teenage intersection\nbetween public and private inquiry—between larger questions about\nthe world, and more private questions about the self? How does genre\nconstruct questions about fear, desire, rage, shame, power, culture, and\nlove? How does it deconstruct reality so it can be seen, investigated,\nand felt?

These narratives deploy stereotypes to characterize non-\nEuropean geographies and people as excessively sensual and cast\noutside the progressive flow of time, waiting to be discovered by the\nwhite traveler. Edward Said termed this projected fantasy of sexual\ndecadence “Orientalism,” or the cultural/historical reduction of “the\nEast” into a stockpile of recognizable tropes. This reduction serves an\nideological goal: to portray the North/West as the intellectual/cultural\nelite, and the South/East as the mere object of the former’s cataloguing\nfetish. This First-Year Writing course interrogates canonical texts of\nnineteenth- and twentieth-century European literature and travel writing\nby formulating questions about the erotic dimension of empires, with\nSaid’s critical intervention as our guide. How is sexuality conﬁgured\nin colonial writing? What do these conﬁgurations tell us about the\nideological map superimposed over the colony and the metropole?\nHow do these constructions of sexuality continue to proliferate in our\ncontemporary moment, and for what political ends?\nFYWB BC1140 FEMINIST FAIRYTALES. 3.00 points.\nIn this class we will read and discuss feminist fairy tales: adaptations\nof classic tales and newly-imagined stories which—rather than\npromising a simple and tidy “happily ever after”—privilege female\nagency and offer up critiques of patriarchal structures. In dialog with\ntexts that center women and other intersecting identities, we will talk\nabout colorism, sexuality, desire, misogyny, motherhood, and more.\nAnalyzing how these texts unmask and challenge various forms of\noppression, we will explore how and why the magical and often didactic\nnature of the fairy tale genre lends itself to thinking critically about\nour current world and to envisioning more equitable futures. Readings\ninclude literary texts by Ovid, Julia Alvarez, Olga Broumas, Charles\nPerrault, Luisa Valenzuela, Nalo Hopkinson, Jeanette Winterson, Amal\nEl-Mohtar, and Kelly Link.

First-Year\nSeminars are designed to develop further the essential and prerequisite\nskills a student brings to Barnard in critical reading and analysis,\nwriting, and effective speaking. First-Year Seminars are intellectually\nchallenging interdisciplinary courses which explore important issues\nthrough signiﬁcant texts ranging across genres and historical periods.\nSeminars also serve to initiate students into the intellectual community\nof the college.\nThe First-Year Seminars\nFirst-Year Seminars fall into two categories: Special\nTopics and Reacting to the Past.\nSpecial Topics seminars reflect the variety of faculty interests\nand expertise, and thus vary in topic from year to year. They offer\nstudents and faculty opportunities to explore topics of interest across\ndisciplinary lines, genres, and historical periods. Use the \"Courses\"\ntab above to view the full Special Topics offerings; current semester\nofferings are indicated with schedule details.\nIn Reacting to the Past seminars, students participate in role-playing\ngames that enable them to relive important intellectual debates in three\nseparate historical moments.\nIn The Threshold of Democracy: Athens in 403 B.C., studentsdraw on\nPlato’s Republic as well as excerpts from Thucydides, Xenophon, and\nother contemporary sources to debate the prospects for Athenian\ndemocracy in the wake of the Peloponnesian War.\nIn Confucianism and the Succession Crisis of the Wanli Emperor ,\nstudents study the Analects of Confucius and apply Confucian thought\nto issues of governance during the Ming dynasty. The ﬁnal semester’s\nﬁnal game varies by section. Some sections explore seventeenth-\ncentury Massachusetts, drawing on the Bible, Calvin's Institutes, and\ncolonial trial testimony to participate in The Trial of Anne Hutchinson.\nOther sections draw on texts by Marx, Freud, and Wollstonecraft to\nexplore the contest between women's suffrage advocates and labor\nactivists for the hearts and minds of \"Bohemian\" Greenwich Village in\nthe spring of 1913.\nStudent Learning Outcomes\n1. Students in First-Year Seminars will develop their skills in critical\nreading and analysis, writing, and effective speaking.\n2. They will assess and use textual evidence in support of oral and\nwritten arguments.\n3. Students will explore important issues through signiﬁcant texts\nranging across genres, disciplines, and historical periods.\nThis program is supervised by the First-Year Experience Committee led\nby:\nFirst-Year Seminar Co-Directors \nPamela Cobrin (Senior Lecturer in English) \nVrinda Condillac (Lecturer in First-Year Writing)\nDirector of First-Year Writing \nWendy Schor-Haim (Senior Lecturer in English)\nDirector of First-Year Writing Workshop \nCecelia Lie-Spahn (Lecturer in English)\nInstruction in the First-\nYear Seminar Program is provided by the following faculty members:\nProfessors, Associate Professors and Assistant Professors \nMark Carnes (History) \nTamara Walker (Africana Studies) \nEmily Black (Computer Science) \nRalph Ghoche (Architecture) \nGale Kenny (Religion)\nCourses of Instruction\nEvery Barnard ﬁrst-year student is required to take a First-Year Seminar\nduring their ﬁrst or second semester at Barnard.

With an emphasis on the reproductive\njustice movement in the United States, which centers the experiences\nand leadership of BIPOC women and LGBTQ people, we will explore a\nvariety of literary works, ﬁlms, journalism, public health studies, and\npolicy/legal texts, all of which differently narrate, debate, script, and\ntheorize about reproduction. Questions we will explore include: what\nis reproduction—scientiﬁcally, culturally, politically, and rhetorically?\nWhat is reproductive justice, and how is it distinct from reproductive\nrights and health? How have recent innovations in medicine and\nreproductive technologies both empowered and harmed reproductive\nexperiences? And what kind of world does the reproductive justice\nmovement urge us to imagine and create? Please note that the\nmaterial for this class discusses obstetric violence; this material is\nimportant for understanding the relationships between race, science,\nand reproductive justice.

How and why do feminist\nauthors, artists, activists, and theorists invoke the future in order to\nanalyze and contest gendered inequalities and dominations that are\nexperienced in the present? What are the consequences of speculation\nin the context of platform design and reproductive technologies?\nWhat is the role of imagination in dealing with archival documents?\nBy posing these and other questions throughout the semester, we will\nexplore numerous issues about the role of speculation, imagination,\nand forecasting in the everyday practice of feminist critique.

With the power to help create life, as well as wreak\ndevastation and destruction, volcanoes inspire awe and terror in equal\nmeasure. This seminar will explore the science behind volcanoes,\ntheir impact on the environment and societies, as well as our enduring\nfascination with them through the lenses of history, arts, mythology\nand religion. Where and why do volcanoes erupt? How do they affect\nnature, climate and society? How has our understanding of these\namazing natural phenomena evolved over time? Why do people stay\nin close proximity to volcanoes, despite the dangers? Can we predict\nwhen the next catastrophic eruption will occur? Can we harness the\npower of volcanic activity as alternative energy source? These are\nsome of the many questions that students will seek to answer and will\nserve as a starting point for our deeper investigation into the subject\nthroughout the semester. Students will study historical texts, case\nstudies, current data and methods of analysis, as well as depictions\nof volcanoes in art and ﬁlm.

This\ncourse aims to clarify the ongoing debate about both the value and\nthe meaning of absorption in visual media. We will begin by comparing\ncontemporary polemics on the decline of attention with writings by\na generation of cultural critics writing in Germany in the 1920s and\n30s, for whom distraction was both a symptom of and a response\nto an increasingly commodiﬁed culture. Next, we’ll draw on recent\ntheorists to help us consider how three representative works (a\npainting, a sequence in a video game, and a chapter from a novel)\nshape the way we attend to them. When we imagine the way we pay\nattention now, we tend to think of ourselves as not reading, and of\nthe book as a medium in decline. In the second half of the class, we’ll\ntherefore turn our attention to the late eighteenth century, when it was\nwidespread reading that seemed strange and new. Together, we’ll focus\non two mixed forms from the period – the epistolary novel and the\nballad collection – that helped make reading itself at once troublingly\ndistracting and dangerously absorbing\nFYSB BC1200 BANNED: DANGEROUS ART. 3.00 points.\nIn this course we will engage with various forms of artistic production\n(literary, cinematic, pictorial, musical) that have been banned or\ncensored by religious authority, governmental institutions, or by public\nopinion. While discussing these primary texts we will investigate who\ngets to censor art, to what ends, and according to which criteria. Who\nis protected from tasteless, subversive, or obscene art?

One in which\nthe common good would be attained by market forces, or one in\nwhich many would be left behind? This course uses a diversity of\nsources to examine the interplay of culture, ethics and economics. The\nstarting point is Adam Smiths work. Economists and policy makers\nhave focused on one side of Adam Smiths work represented by self-\nregarding behavior and the supremacy of the invisible hand in market\nfunctioning. However, Adam Smith also pointed out that one of humans\ncentral emotions is sympathy, a natural tendency to care about the\nwell-being of others. In light of the recent events as well as research\nthis other side of Adam Smiths work appears now more relevant. We\nanalyze evidence of cooperative versus self-regarding behaviors and its\nrelationship with the economy, human evolution and cultural values in\na variety of settings. Readings include works from Adam Smith, Milton\nFreedman, Charles Dickens, David Rockefeller and Chris Gardner\nFYSB BC1294 ART, SEX # AMERICAN CULTURE. 3.00 points.\nSex is the ultimate forbidden public topic and yet from the New\nEngland Puritans' sermons to Bill Clinton's (in)famous affair, sex has\noften been publicly staged in dramatic, literary, religious, political,\nlegal and social forums. In this seminar, we will explore how issues of\nsex and sexuality have insinuated themselves into the formation of\nAmerican identity. We will examine texts from the seventeenth century\nto the present with a particular emphasis on the arts, politics and sex.\nTexts include Puritan sermons, Nathaniel Hawthorne's The Scarlet\nLetter, Tennessee Williams's Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, Suzan-Lori Parks's\nVenus, photographs by Robert Mapplethorpe, literature from Margaret\nSanger's birth control movement, and theoretical works by Michel\nFoucault, Laura Mulvey and Judith Butler\nFall 2024: FYSB BC1294\nCourse\nNumber\nSection/Call\nNumber\nTimes/Location Instructor Points Enrollment\nFYSB 1294 001/00596 T Th 4:10pm - 5:25pm \n403 Barnard Hall\nPamela Cobrin 3.00 16/16\nFYSB BC1296 The Hudson: America's River. 3 points.\nCalled \"America's River,\" the Hudson not only runs right behind our\ncampus, but right through American history. Throughout American\nhistory the Hudson River has been a complex social and cultural\nentity, simultaneously a commercial conduit, a historic place at the\ncenter of the American Revolution, an industrial resource, and a\nprivileged site for aesthetic experiences and the as birthplace of\nmodern environmentalism. In this course you will explore the Hudson\nin relationship to the varied historical communities which have made\nmeaning with it, identifying its contributions to discourses of nation\nand nature, but also race, gender, art and science. Readings will include\nliterary works by Washington Irving and James Fenimore Cooper\nas well as essays and poems on subjects from fairies to trees to\narchitecture to railroad travel. Close analysis of works of architecture,\nlandscape design, and the iconic paintings of the Hudson River School\nwill be accompanied by an exploration of the various methods for\n\"reading\" these objects and paintings.

However, not all feminist anger is received or interpreted in\nthe same way; not all women have had the same freedom to express\nor represent anger. This course asks us to think critically about\nexpressions and perceptions of anger. How do race, sexuality, gender\nidentity, class, and ethnicity shape who is perceived as “angry” and\nwhose anger is taken seriously? What other affects circulate and\ninteract with anger: from rage and irritation to wonder and joy? We’ll\nbegin with the ﬁgure of the “feminist killjoy,” as theorized by Sara\nAhmed and will consider texts by authors including Audre Lorde,\nAdrienne Rich, June Jordan, Susan Stryker, and Nella Larsen, alongside\nmanifestos, comics, ﬁlm, visual art, and zines.\nFall 2024: FYSB BC1337\nCourse\nNumber\nSection/Call\nNumber\nTimes/Location Instructor Points Enrollment\nFYSB 1337 001/00597 M W 11:40am - 12:55pm \n405 Barnard Hall\nMeredith\nBenjamin\n3 15/16\nSpring 2025: FYSB BC1337\nCourse\nNumber\nSection/Call\nNumber\nTimes/Location Instructor Points Enrollment\nFYSB 1337 001/00498 M W 11:40am - 12:55pm \n403 Barnard Hall\nMeredith\nBenjamin\n3 16/16\nFYSB BC1400 Walking and Looking. 3 points.\nWalking and looking are among the most \"natural\" of human activities.\nBut what really goes on--physiologically, culturally, socially--when\nwe engage in them? And what can we learn if we examine the two\npractices together, as fundamental parts of how humans explore\ntheir world? This course will study how the interacting behaviors of\nwalking and looking have been represented in word and image, from\nthe Bible to Impressionist painters to Hollywood ﬁlms. Our base texts\nwill be Wanderlust: A History of Walking by Rebecca Solnit (2000) and On\nLooking: A Walker's Guide to the Art of Observation by Alexandra Horowitz\n(2013).\nFYSB BC1421 CROSSING BORDERS: AMERICAS. 3.00 points.\nThis course cuts across the borders between North, South and Central\nAmerica and the Caribbean, in a search for the ways in which literature\nilluminates different aspects of American identity. We see the Americas\nas active historical and aesthetic agents, acting and interacting\nwith each other. We might even say that modernity, in the sense of\nfreedom from tradition, ﬁrst developed in the Americas; as a result,\nthe literatures of the Americas are characterized by diversity and\ninnovation from their beginning. We will devote particular attention to\nthe roots of Modernism in North and South America at the end of the\n19th century, and the development of modernism, post-modernism and\npost-colonialism in the 20th and early 21st centuries through the study\nof key novels, short stories, and poetry from North and South America\nand the Caribbean. By looking at these works in their historical, political\nand aesthetic contexts, we can grapple with the multiple formations of\nAmerican identities. Though class discussions are in English, students\nare encouraged, to the greatest extent possible, to read the works in the\noriginal language. Latinx students are particularly welcome\nFYSB BC1422 Art, AIDS, Activism. 3 points.\nThis seminar explores the varied ways artists responded to the AIDS\ncrisis of the 1980s and 90s. As government indifference persisted\nand deaths soared, artists became radicalized and contemporary\nart became a vehicle for activism. We will follow different tactics\nin artwork responding to AIDS including the use of gay desire as\na weapon and emblem of the ﬁght for visibility. The work we will\nview, think about, discuss, and write about is political, often angry,\nand always tinged with loss. Because AIDS affected marginalized\ncommunities, whose histories are still being told, we will examine a\nrange of artists and materials that includes but also moves beyond the\ngay white male perspective. We will spend time with videos by Juanita\nMohammad, visual art by Kia LaBeija, Feliz Gonzalez-Torres, and David\nWojnarowicz, plays by Reza Abdoh and Tony Kushner, and the writings\nof Audre Lorde, Essex Hemphill, and Sarah Schulman. The ﬁnal project\nwill be an academic/creative hybrid: students will develop and pitch\ntheir own activist artwork.\nFYSB BC1460 Memory. 3 points.\nMemory is arguably the most important faculty that we possess. Not\nsurprisingly, memory has been a ubiquitous topic in poetry, science,\nﬁction, and in the media. Ironically, memory's value is perhaps best\nunderstood when it ceases to exist. Indeed, it isn't hard to imagine\nthe devastation that comes with memory loss. In this course, we will\nsurvey various components of memory, including its role in writing\nand history, and its existence in various non-human populations. In\naddition, we will explore the fragility of memory, including distortions,\nunusual memories, and basic forgetting. Readings will include poems,\ntheoretical essays, scientiﬁc articles, and ﬁction. Assignments will\nconsist of essays, opinion pieces, and creative stories. Students will\nalso participate in a ﬁnal in-class debate.  Readings will include works\nfrom William Blake, James Joyce, Mary Elizabeth Coleridge, Emily\nDickinson, Ben Jonson, Mary Carruthers, Francis Yates, Aristotle,\nWilliam James, Elizabeth Loftus, Spinoza, Luria, J.L. Borges, S. Freud,\nOliver Sacks, Truman Capote\nFYSB BC1465 On Dreams and Nightmares. 3 points.\nIn the dead of night it is not uncommon for even the most socially staid\nof individuals to fly, to ride an elephant at breakneck speed, to visit\nwith the dead, or to expose themselves in public. Ancient Egyptians\nstruggled to understand how and why we dream, as have countless\nindividuals in other times and cultures. Some thinkers, ancient\nand modern, have dismissed dreams as essentially meaningless\nbyproducts of natural processes. Others have taken dreams seriously\nas a primary means of access to an ordinarily imperceivable world in\nwhich one can commune with spirits and deities and receive from them\nvaluable information about future events or even one's own health. The\nimplications of this belief have led to vigorous theological debates as\nto whose dreams may be trusted (and, alternatively, whose need to be\nactively suppressed). From Freud onward, many have felt that dreams\noffer the key not to other worlds but to the complicated realm of the\npsyche. Over the course of our semester we'll look at how scientists,\nphilosophers, hypochondriacs, pious pagans and monotheists, opium\naddicts, psychologists, playwrights, novelists, artists, and ﬁlm directors\nhave understood dreams and been inspired by them. Authors whose\nworks we'll read include Aristotle, Cicero, Chung Tzu, Freud, Carl\nJung, Andre Breton, H.P. Lovecraft, Jorge Borges, Ursula Le Guin, Neil\nGaimon, and many others. Special attention will likewise be paid to\nthe phenomenon of lucid dreaming and to the immense influence this\npractice has had on the creative output of both writers and ﬁlmmakers.", "source": "pdfs/barnard 2024-2025.pdf"}

However, there are many ways to deﬁne the term and\nassess the long-term effects of so-called sustainable measures. In this\ncourse, we will examine current and historical writings about human\ninteractions with the environment in order to understand and identify\nour most profound environmental challenges and the most appropriate\nresponses. Responding critically to the ideas of the past, we will also\nask how our views have changed over time and what it might take to\ntackle the current large- scale.\nFYSB BC1469 LIBERATION. 3.00 points.\nLiberation can be deﬁned as freedom from limits on thought or\nbehavior. More speciﬁcally, it can be deﬁned as setting someone (or\noneself) free from imprisonment, slavery, or oppression. This seminar\nexamines political, philosophical, aesthetic, and theological traditions\nand movements for liberation, with an emphasis on collective liberation\nFYSB BC1474 Think Like A Scientist: From Plato to Hawking. 3 points.\nThis course will examine the “scientiﬁc worldview” throughout the\nhistory of the Western world. Key questions will include: how do\nscience and philosophy intersect to influence our views of nature?;\nhow does science help us to understand our place in the world and in\nthe universe?; what happens when objective scientiﬁc inquiry clashes\nwith political and societal interests?; how does popular opinion affect\nthe way that science is conducted? In attempting to answer these\nquestions, we will reflect on what it means to use what we have learned\n(from both science and history) to synthesize new viewpoints that can\nhave a positive impact on our future.\nFYSB BC1583 CARIBBEAN DIASPORA LITERATURE IN NEW YORK. 3\npoints.\nHistorically, Caribbean cultures have been profoundly affected\nand shaped by the massive displacement and migration of their\npopulations. In this course, we will examine how this condition of\ndisplacement is articulated in the writings of the Caribbean diaspora\nand how these literary representations of mobility, migration, and\nintercultural contact reflect current globalizing processes and\ndiscourses. Texts will be drawn from the Francophone, Anglophone,\nand Hispanic Caribbean diaspora. These include the novel The Mimic\nMen by the recent Nobel-Prize-winning Trinidadian writer V.S. Naipaul;\nthe novel Lucy by the Antiguan writer Jamaica Kincaid; and short\nstories by Junot Díaz and Edwidge Danticat, writers of Dominican\nand Haitian descent respectively, the latter a Barnard graduate. These\nreadings will be complemented by essays from critics such as Edouard\nGlissant, Stuart Hall, and James Clifford.\nFYSB BC1597 Taboo and Transgression. 3 points.\nThis seminar explores taboo and transgression within a range of\nmythic, scientiﬁc, anthropological, psychoanalytical, feminist, and\nliterary work. Topics include the treatment of the corpse during the\nPaleolithic, the centrality of the incest taboo in kinship studies, and the\nequation of secular modernity with the successive breaking of taboos.\nFYSB BC1598 Building Utopia. 3.00 points.\nBuilding Utopia explores the rich tradition of utopian thinking across\nliterature, social philosophy, architecture, and the visual arts. Here,\nutopia is examined in its modern form: as a call to transform the world\nthrough human planning and ingenuity. Aside from a vital excursion\non Thomas More's pivotal novel Utopia (1516), the course focuses\non nineteenth- and twentieth-century thinkers whose often wild and\nidealistic imaginings profoundly affected the shape of the real world.\nStudents will delve into the works of Marie Howland, Edward Bellamy,\nthe Italian Futurists, and Le Corbusier, among many others.

We will also ask what the performing arts and visual arts\nof the past have to say about issues confronted in the arts of the\npresent. This will help us to understand how evolving aesthetic\nmovements such as realism, impressionism, and modernism promote\nand critique our cultural perspectives and our social values.

What motivates a\nperson to tell his or her life story, or to investigate someone else’s,\nand how are these stories bound by both authors and readers to\nnarratives of citizenship, belonging, and/or exclusion? What motivates\na writer to share what she shares, and what motivates an audience to\ndemand what it demands from her?

In literature, this work is done\nthrough careful close-reading and paying attention to how the struggle\nfor independence is represented in literary texts, both on an individual\nand collective level. In this course, we will push the boundaries of\nthe discipline of postcolonial studies and use its methodologies to\nread about locations and peoples that weren’t formerly (or formally)\ncolonized (for example, Ancient Greece, New Orleans during Hurricane\nKatrina, 20thcentury Iran, and female Jewish immigrants in New York\ncity circa 1910).

In happy coincidence, 2019 is the 150th anniversary of\nDimitri Mendeleev’s publication of an organized chart of the chemical\nelements, as well as the year of Walt Whitman’s 200th birthday. We will\ncelebrate the Periodic Table with Mendeleev as one of humanity’s great\nintellectual achievements and sing elemental songs with Whitman on\nscales minute and enormous, instantaneous and eternal.

Most of the\nassigned material will be based on primary research in the social\nsciences, along with a small number of documentaries, novels, and/\nor memoirs. Assigned books may include Arlie Hochschild, Strangers\nin their Own Land; Eric Klinenberg, Palaces for the People; Barbara\nRansby, Making All Black Lives Matter; Rachel Sherman, Uneasy Street:\nThe Anxieties of Affluence; and Jeffrey M.

We will read both canonical and non-canonical\nwritings from the colonial and modern periods as well as indigenous\nliterature. The course will place this tradition in dialogue with the\nmost recent developments of eco-feminism, materialist ontologies,\ndiscussions of environmental justice, “deep ecology,” and the rights of\nnon-human nature.

The writing labs for this section will take place on the\nfollowing Fridays, 11:40 am-12:55 pm: 1/31, 2/14, 2/28, 3/6, 3/27, and\n4/3\nFYSB BC1733 Women # Comedy. 3.00 points.\n“What a language it is, the laughter of women, high-flying and\nsubversive. Long before law and scripture we heard the laughter,\nwe understood freedom.” -Lisel Mueller “I’m not funny, what I am is\nbrave.” - Lucille Ball This course focuses on the intersection between\ncomedy and gender, race, class and sexuality. We will explore laughter\nas a subversive act and how the identity of a “funny woman” can be\nboth dangerous and liberating. As Margo Jefferson writes, “Given the\nhistory of social restriction and sexual regulation, how many women\nhave been in a position to – or been willing to – take these risks?” We\nwill explore how the tools of comedy can be used to make mischief,\nto transgress the bounds of genre and form and to contest popular\nideas about difference and power. How can humor be illuminating?\nHow can humor be feminist? How can humor be intersectional? How\ncan humor help us tell the hard truths? Can we laugh at oppression\nwithout laughing it off? At every step, we will put our inquiry into action\n– trying our hand at satire, sketch and storytelling to explore our own\nintersections. Readings may include Audre Lorde’s Sister Outsider,\nSamantha Chanse’s Lydia’s Funeral Video and Patricia Lockwood’s\nMotherland Fatherland Homelandsexuals\nFYSB BC1734 CULTURE, IDENTITY, & THE SELF. 3 points.\nIn this First Year Seminar, we explore how people discover themselves\nand others in the frameworks of different cultures and times. Our focus\nis on the idea of the self (who are you?) and the other (who are you\nnot?), and we investigate these concepts as they appear in six great\nbooks from Western and Non-Western sources. The texts include: The\nEpic of Gilgamesh, The Aeneid, The Golden Legend, Austin's Emma,\nSatrapi's Persepolis, and Woolf's A Room of One's One. Additionally, we\nwill contrast these with their movie versions and a visit to a museum.\nStudents in this class will develop key fundamental skills, such as\nactive reading and analysis, how to write in different rhetorical modes,\nand how to verbalize and present ideas effectively.\nFYSB BC1735 IS GOD DEAD?. 3 points.\nFriedrich Nietzsche’s 1882 pronouncement that “God is dead” is one of\nthe most notorious and widely-referenced criticisms of the relationship\nbetween Theology and Modernity in contemporary thought. But\nwhat does it mean to say “God is dead,” in fact? What was Nietzsche\ntalking about? How might this statement be “true”? How might it\nbe inaccurate? In this class, we will use Nietzsche’s statement as a\njumping-off point to begin thinking about how modern ideas about the\ncontinuities and distinctions between religion and politics developed\nbetween the 16th to the 20th centuries in such a way that to say “God\nis dead” became a meaningful summation of Modernity. In addition to\nNietzsche, we will read classical and critical works of political theology\nfrom a diverse array of authors such as Jean Bodin, Thomas Hobbes,\nBenedict de Spinoza, Beatriz Kampa Vita, Carl Schmitt, Max Weber,\nZora Neale Hurston, W.E.B. DuBois, and Simone Weil to answer for\nquestions: What does it mean to talk about God? Is God dead? If so,\nwhen and how did God die? And if God is not dead, how has God been\nkept alive — and where can this ﬁgure be found today?\nFYSB BC1736 TECH & SOCIETY: GOOD, BAD & OTHER. 3 points.\nComputing and information technology has improved our lives in\nmany ways, contributing to signiﬁcant advances in science and\nmedicine; making it easy and efﬁcient to communicate with people\nacross the world; and enabling online business and recreational\nactivities; and more. However, the same technologies can also have\nnegative impacts, such as the move to a surveillance society and\nsurveillance capitalism; major disruptions in the workforce of the\nfuture as automation becomes more widespread; and social media\ncontributing to depression in young people and the weaponization of\ndisinformation. This seminar will explore technical, cultural, legal, and\neconomic factors that can impact how computing technology is used,\nwhile raising the question of how to encourage and ensure that these\ntechnologies are used for good, while eliminating or mitigating the\npotential negative impacts.", "source": "pdfs/barnard 2024-2025.pdf"}

This seminar examines some of the historical and contemporary\nexpressions of contagion as moral and ethical experience. We will\ninterrogate the surveillance systems that are utilized by modern\ngovernments and economies not only as public health goods and\nprivate sector assets, but also legacies of conquest, colonialism,\nand capitalism. Finally, we explore the role of care within these\nsystems, its inherent power dynamics, and the politics of vulnerability.\nTexts include (and are not limited to) Katherine Anne Porter’s Pale\nHorse, Pale Fire; excerpts from Camus, Galeano, Sontag, Foucault;\nhistorical and sociological accounts of tuberculosis; anthropological\nand ethnographic accounts of the global HIV epidemic; feminist\nphilosophers on the politics of care and the sciences (e.g., Sandra\nLaugier, Annemarie Mol); and written and audio journalism topical to\nthese accounts.\nFYSB BC1738 Activism, Performance, Social Movements. 3.00 points.\nThis seminar examines how activism shapes the political process\nthrough performance, and how social movements often spread by\ntheatrical means. We start our exploration with the notion of \"the\npublics\" as introduced by the twentieth-century German philosopher\nJürgen Habermas and then expand our view of this concept to\nthe contemporary political setting. We look at both how elected\nrepresentatives use theatrical tropes to shape their public personas,\nand also how popular protests stage large-scale public interventions.\nHow might performance as a series of citational strategies allow us\nto think about the political process? How do we assess the success\nor failure of a tactic in a social movement? We will draw heavily on\nthe works of feminist scholars like bell hooks, Judith Butler, Kimberle\nCrenshaw, and Peggy Phelan, to discuss movements such as ACT UP,\nOccupy Wall Street, Black Lives Matter, #MeToo. Equally, we will look\nat histories of student activism such as the 1968 Morningside Park\ngym construction, campus anti-apartheid actions, Carry That Weight\nat Columbia and Barnard, and Friday School Climate Strike and March\nfor our Lives. Students reflect on their own histories or experiences\nwith activism, as personal involvement and/or politics of the places\nthey come from. Through the semester students are exposed to various\ntechniques of protest performance including zines, podcasts, art\ncampaigns and poetry circles. Based on shared interests and afﬁnities,\nstudents work in groups to class devise activist performances as a\nﬁnal project\nFYSB BC1739 Dead and Undead (Wkshop). 4.00 points.\nWhat does it mean to be dead? Why the fascination—across time\nand culture—with conceiving of ways in which the dead can become\nun-dead? And how is being undead different from being alive? To\ninvestigate and trouble the boundaries between life and death (and\nun-death), we will analyze works from various genres and media,\ndiscussing near-death experiences, beating-heart cadavers, and a\nrange of ﬁgures including zombies, ghosts, and other revenants.\nObjects of study include texts by Zora Neale Hurston, Ovid, Montaigne,\nShakespeare, Edgar Allen Poe, Nalo Hopkinson, and Mary Shelley;\nmusic by Camille Saint-Saëns; artwork by Hans Holbein and Breughel;\ntelevision and ﬁlm (Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Tim Burton’s\nFrankenweenie); and more.

But what precisely are\nwe referring to when we use this term? Drawing on psychoanalytic and\nanthropological approaches, our seminar will interrogate the politics\nof diagnosing, treating and healing from disturbing past events. We\nwill watch ﬁlms and read case histories of hysteria, studies of infants,\nand attempts to integrate mind, brain and body. The course will also\nexamine the rise of PTSD, attend to questions of intergenerational\ntransmission, and learn about responses to national and racial trauma.\nFeatured authors include Sigmund Freud, Beatrice Beebe, Allan Young,\nMarilyn Ivy and Resmaa Menakem\nFall 2024: FYSB BC1740\nCourse\nNumber\nSection/Call\nNumber\nTimes/Location Instructor Points Enrollment\nFYSB 1740 001/00607 T Th 1:10pm - 2:25pm \n403 Barnard Hall\nNicholas\nBartlett\n3.00 16/16\nFYSB BC1741 Science and Society on Screen. 3 points.\nWhen we turn on TV and go to the movies we are typically looking to\nbe entertained. When it comes to science on screen is the purpose for\nentertainment or education? How do science-related movies and TV\nreflect but also impact society? Can movies and TV be used to discuss\nthe complex intersection between science and society and how are\nthey received by the public? To discuss these questions and more, we\nwill analyze texts, including Silent Spring and Demon Haunted World\nand visual media such as Hidden Figures, The Twilight Zone, and Erin\nBrokovich.", "source": "pdfs/barnard 2024-2025.pdf"}
{"page_index": 373, "page_content": "Barnard College Catalogue 2024-2025 373\nFYSB BC1742 Journeys. 3.00 points.\nThe journey is a central motif in narrative writing dating back many\nthousands of years. The classical example of the journey comes from\nthe experiences of Odysseus in Homer’s The Odyssey but journeys also\nfeature in the narratives of the Hebrew Bible as well as the Buddha.\nThe idea of the journey as a transformative experience has remained\nrelevant and, indeed, become so prevalent that it is arguably the\nfoundation of modern popular culture. This class examines the idea of\nthe journey (and travel in a wider sense) through ﬁve primary analytic\nframeworks. The course begins (framework #1) with the interplay\nbetween travel and wonder as epitomized in the classical Islamic\nliterary tradition through the travel accounts of Battuta and the famous\nstory of Sinbad. It then turns to Jonathan Swift’s use of travel as a\nmeans for social satire in Gulliver’s Travels (framework #2) before\ndrawing on William James’ psychological framework to consider the\njourney as a metaphor for conversion (framework #3) through the\nexample of Malcolm X. The course then considers travel writing in\nthe modern period as a performative or confessional act through\nrepresentative examples from Kerouac, Didion, Krakauer, and Gilbert.\nThis is followed by an engagement with Joseph Campbell’s notion of\nthe monomyth as embodied by the ﬁlms Star Wars: A New Hope (1977)\nand Spirited Away (1991). The ﬁnal reading in the course centers on\nOctavia Butler’s Kindred which depicts a series of voyages through\ntime that demand a reckoning or confrontation with the past\nFYSB BC1743 Existentialism in Lit # Film. 3.00 points.\nThis seminar explores literary and cinematic depictions of themes in\nexistential thought. The term “existentialism” was ﬁrst coined to refer\nto German and French philosophy from (roughly) 1920 to 1950, but it\nalso applies to writers of the previous century, especially Kierkegaard,\nDostoevsky, and Nietzsche. Moreover, its central subjects – perennial\nmatters of human concern such freedom, anxiety, alienation, faith, the\nmeaning of life ­– can be found in ﬁction and cinema, from Kafka to\nMartin Scorsese. Authors will also include Camus, Sartre, and Beauvoir,\nand we will watch and discuss ﬁlms directed by Carol Reed, Alain\nResnais, Jean-Luc Godard, and Michelangelo Antonioni\nFYSB BC1744 Here/There: Migrant Narratives. 3.00 points.\nThis ﬁrst-year seminar brings together texts, ﬁlms and contemporary\nart that focus on migrant, immigrant, refugee, expat and exile\nexperiences. We will explore how migrant subjects negotiate dominant\ndiscourses of nationality and citizenship, and how their identities as\nmigrants intersect with their other positionalities, with a particular\nemphasis on race, gender and queerness. Some questions we will\nconsider: How are immigrant, migrant and refugees marginalized,\nracialized and queered by dominant discourses? How do immigrants,\nmigrants and refugees negotiate belonging when they cross\ncultural, national, linguistic and religious borders? How do these\nauthors, ﬁlmmakers and artists resist erasure and complicate our\nunderstanding of home, belonging and identity? Texts are subject\nto change but will likely include authors such as Gloria Anzaldúa,\nJames Baldwin, Kazim Ali, Fatimah Asghar, Ocean Vuong, Karla Cornejo\nVillavicencio, Masha Gessen, Viet Thanh Nguyen, as well as selected\nﬁlms, documentaries, visual art and other media\nFall 2024: FYSB BC1744\nCourse\nNumber\nSection/Call\nNumber\nTimes/Location Instructor Points Enrollment\nFYSB 1744 001/00608 T Th 2:40pm - 3:55pm \n403 Barnard Hall\nDuygu Ula 3.00 16/16\nSpring 2025: FYSB BC1744\nCourse\nNumber\nSection/Call\nNumber\nTimes/Location Instructor Points Enrollment\nFYSB 1744 001/00381 T Th 2:40pm - 3:55pm \n404 Barnard Hall\nDuygu Ula 3.00 14/16\nFYSB BC1745 The Soul of the Nation?. 3.00 points.\nOne will hear from across the political spectrum references to an entity\ncalled the “soul of the nation.” But how to think about this mystiﬁed\nidea? This seminar explores the literary history of the idea of the\nsoul in connection with the question of American identity. By way of\ninterdisciplinary readings from theology, philosophy, and science in\naccord with readings in American prose and poetry, we come to see\nhow the concept of the soul changes over time as scientiﬁc innovation\nleads culture to reassess what counts as reality. We learn to navigate\nthe arc and contour of this literary history and sharpen our sensitivity\nto what’s at stake in contemporary uses of the soul’s idea, insofar as\nthey inflect how we think about important questions as what should\nbe valued about the nation and within our lives. Readings will include\nJames Baldwin, St. Augustine, René Descartes, Ralph Waldo Emerson,\nHenry David Thoreau, Charles Darwin, Audre Lorde, and Antonio\nDamasio\nFYSB BC1746 WOMEN OF COLOR IN SPECULATIVE LITERATURE. 3.00\npoints.\n“The Future is Female” except in science ﬁction, where it still looks\npretty white and male. What happens when women of color take on\nsuch tropes as space exploration, cybernetics, superpowers, and\nthe end of the world? How can women of color change the way we\nnot only think of the future, but think of the present as well? In this\nﬁrst-year seminar, we’ll look at how speculative literature approaches\nthe intersections of race, gender, class, sexuality, technology, and\nenvironmental concerns. Readings will include work from such authors\nas Octavia Butler, Franny Choi, Sam Chanse, G Willow Wilson, and\nTananarive Due with potential critical readings from Lisa Yaszek,\nCharlotte E Howell, and bell hooks", "source": "pdfs/barnard 2024-2025.pdf"}
{"page_index": 374, "page_content": "374  First-Year Seminar\nFYSB BC1747 Writing Caribbean Feminisms. 3.00 points.\nThis course offers an in-depth engagement with the Critical Caribbean\nFeminisms series, organized at Barnard College since 2015. These in-\nperson conversations with contemporary Caribbean and Caribbean\ndiaspora women authors and the accompanying podcast series center\ntheir experience with race, gender, diaspora, and writing. In this course\nwe consider how the authors’ thoughts on the Caribbean, feminism,\nand their experience in the U.S. are represented and expanded\nupon in their writings through close readings of their novels, short\nstories, essays, and poems. The course culminates with each student\nproposing a Caribbean woman writer to add to the podcast series and\nsuggesting how this writer’s voice resonates with and expands on\nthe authors and themes studied throughout the course. Some of the\nauthors we will read and discuss are Jamaica Kincaid, Audre Lorde,\nClaudia Rankine, Edwidge Danticat, and Roxane Gay, among many\nothers\nFYSB BC1748 Immortality, Death, # Meaning in Life. 3.00 points.\nHow are conceptions of the self tied to notions of temporality and\nmortality, life and the end of life? This seminar will take us on an\nexploration of various attitudes one can have towards the prospect of\ndeath, and what such attitudes might reflect about the meaning of life.\nWe will address the coherence and desirability of immortality in both\nits literal and metaphorical senses. In what manner might one ‘live on’\nthrough one's creations? Does death render life meaningless, or does it\ngive meaning to life? Works include readings by Tolstoy, Albert Camus,\nVirginia Woolf, as well as poetry, artwork, and plays\nFYSB BC1749 Psychopolitics. 3.00 points.\nWhat shapes our psychic lives today? How are histories of pain and\npossibility transmitted, ruptured, and transformed across generations?\nThis class draws on anthropology, psychoanalysis, critical theories,\nliterature, and poetry to explore the politics of the psyche. We will\nread writings by bell hooks, Frantz Fanon, Natalie Diaz, Ocean Vuong,\nSigmund Freud, Michel Foucault, Gananath Obeyesekere, David Eng,\nShinhee Han, and others. We begin with common encounters that\ninform and disrupt our lives, move to concepts of self and culture,\nexplore how these are inflected by violent histories and extractive\neconomies, and end with questions of what lives on\nFYSB BC1750 Literature on Trial. 3.00 points.\nWhy are novels so interested in trials? What is the relationship between\nliterary and legal interpretation, and between the role of a reader and\nthat of a juror? How do we interpret “facts” in a literary text versus a\nlegal context? What does justice look like in a literary work? In this\ncourse, we will read works that feature trials in order to explore the\nrelationship between the literary and the legal, two very different\nways of making sense of the world that collide in literature about\ntrials. We will put literary characters on trial in order to explore how\nguilt, judgment, and redemption operate in the works we read, and\nto consider our own role and responsibility as readers. Readings\nwill include works by James Baldwin, Fyodor Dostoevsky, Vladimir\nNabokov, Claudia Rankine, and Marjane Satrapi\nFYSB BC1751 Creativity and Inspiration. 3.00 points.\nWhere do creative ideas come from? The Muses, according to Plato.\nThe unconscious, according to some later thinkers. One thing both\nanswers share is the thought that creative ideas come from something\n“other than” or “not controlled by” the creator – or, as we’ll put it,\nthat creativity requires inspiration. In this class, we will explore this\nand related ideas in Western thinking about creativity. In doing so,\nwe’ll examine how creative people themselves, from painters to\nmathematicians, have described their own creative process and\nexperiences. We’ll examine approaches to creativity from the Taoist\ntradition, comparing them with the Western approaches that will be our\nmain focus. At the end of the class, we’ll think about whether computer\nprograms can be creative, and what it might mean for claims about\ninspiration if they can be. Readings will include selections from Simone\nde Beauvoir, Margaret Boden, Chung-yuan Chang, bell hooks, Sigmund\nFreud, Immanuel Kant, Iris Murdoch, Martha Nussbaum, and others\nFall 2024: FYSB BC1751\nCourse\nNumber\nSection/Call\nNumber\nTimes/Location Instructor Points Enrollment\nFYSB 1751 001/00609 T Th 11:40am - 12:55pm \nLl001 Milstein Center\nChristopher\nProdoehl\n3.00 16/16\nFYSB BC1752 Dreamstories. 3.00 points.\nThe complex relationship between dreaming and narrative storytelling\nis as contemporary as it is ancient. In this ﬁrst-year seminar, we\nwill examine Greco-Roman, medieval, modern, and postmodern\nrepresentations of dreaming in literature, philosophy and ﬁlm - texts\nthat range from classical epic (Homer, Virgil) through medieval allegory\n(Dante, Machaut) to psychoanalysis (Freud and his contemporaries),\nqueer metaﬁction (Winterson, Sarduy, Lynch), and beyond. We will\nconsider among other topics how dreams raise fundamental questions\nabout being, memory, desire, interpretation, and Utopian politics.\nStudents will practice critical writing and discussion, and also have the\nopportunity to engage their own dreams and fantasies both analytically\nand creatively\nFYSB BC1753 Illusion. 3.00 points.\nHow do you know that what you see or sense is real? What if what you\nthought you knew about the world, other people, and yourself, was\nwrong? In this course we will look at the idea of illusion through several\ndifferent discourses including philosophical, religious, scientiﬁc,\npolitical, and artistic. We will consider skeptical positions on the\nexternal world, consciousness and free will; we will look at debates\nabout self-deception and political ideology. We will discuss fantasies\nand dreams, and consider whether being in love or being a child\nhave illusory dimensions. And throughout we will consider works\nof art (especially ﬁlm and photography), and will ask whether art\nitself is a kind of illusion. We will also consider normative and ethical\nquestions: is it always bad to be under some illusion? Are individuals\nblameworthy when they are taken in by an illusion? Can illusions ever\nbe helpful? Historical authors include: Plato, Vasubandhu, Sextus\nEmpiricus, Descartes, Marx, Nietzsche, Freud, Baldwin, Butler. Films to\nbe screened include: Imitation of Life and The Last Unicorn", "source": "pdfs/barnard 2024-2025.pdf"}

The\nU.S.- Mexico border delimits more than nations; it is both a political\nand a social geography, marked by bodies of water, mountains, walls,\nideologies, repression, and resistance. The crisis currently taking place\nat the border is an unfolding story with many narrators. We will study\nliterary texts: ﬁction, poetry, and memoir written by those who know\nthe border, and borderlands, intimately. We will also engage histories,\nsocial movement doctrine, and media coverage to mine the stories\nthey tell.

With an emphasis on intersectional\napproaches to reproductive justice, we’ll read a variety of literary works,\njournalism, ﬁlms and television shows, public health studies, and\npolicy/legal texts, all of which differently narrate, debate, script, and\ntheorize about reproduction. Questions we will explore include: what\nstories do we tell about reproduction? What role have innovations in\nreproductive technologies played in this process, from contraceptive\nuses of medicinal plants, to in-vitro fertilization and so-called “DIY”\nabortions, to population and development projects all over the world?\nHow do long histories of obstetric violence inform modern deﬁnitions\nof reproductive health, rights, and justice?

In the context of the climate emergency\nand the vast global social and environmental changes it both brings\nand demands, this course asks: what is change, and how do we do it?\nStudents will identify and characterize different change processes,\nand analyze strategies for adapting to, mitigating, accelerating,\nor shaping change. Readings and projects will explore activism,\neducation, research, storytelling, and performances by scientists,\nartists, indigenous leaders, and activists including Paul Hawken, Ruth\nDeFries, Janine Benyus, Cynthia Li, Atul Gawande, Octavia Butler,\nAdrienne Maree Brown, Rosi Braidotti, Ian Hodder, Robin Wall Kimmerer,\nElizabeth Kolbert, Naomi Klein, and Suzan-Lori Parks.

Things can\nspark joy, grant authority, lead to our demise, and reveal our deepest\nsecrets. They mediate social relationships, deﬁne political alliances,\nand provide economic opportunities. Sometimes it is not the presence\nof things but their absence – a misplaced phone, an expired passport,\na childhood home – that more keenly shapes our reality. While people\nmake objects, objects also make people. This class will investigate\nthe secret life of stuff, from maps to cups and buildings to body parts,\nto explore how inanimate objects can be seen to have an agency\nand power of their own. Our discussions will draw on a wide array of\nauthors from a variety of ﬁelds, including Bill Brown, Martin Heidigger,\nAnni Albers, Neel Ahuja, Katherine Ott, Bruno Latour, Donna Haraway,\nand Anna Tsing.

From Jonathan Swift’s “A Modest Proposal” (1729) to the\npolitical-promise-turned-ﬁction of 40 acres and a mule following the\nU.S. Civil War, we will also examine the legal, historical, and literary\nrepresentations of food at the heart (and belly) of the human story.\nCore texts will include Hannah Arendt’s On Revolution (1963), Andrea\nStuart’s Sugar in the Blood: A Family's Story of Slavery and Empire\n(2016), Paul Beatty’s The Sellout (2015), Vandana Shiva’s Manifestoes\non the Future of Food and Seed (2007), Bong Joon-ho’s Okja (2017),\nand Andreas Johnsen’s Bugs (2016).

We\nwill read and discuss short stories, novels, and memoirs that reflect on\nor call into question the narrator’s reasons for telling the story. We will\nalso consider essays by literary critics, psychologists, and scientists\non the human impulse to narrate. Literary texts may include works by\nHenry James, Franz Kafka, Jorge Luis Borges, Shirley Jackson, Haruki\nMurakami, and Carmen Maria Machado.

Or is it? Poetry is archaic. Poetry is academic. Poetry\nis hard. Or in the words of Ntosake Shange, it’s “razzamatazz hocus\npocus zippity-do-dah.” The magic of poetry is not in its mystery, but in\nits ability to connect with people, and to connect people with people,\neven across space and time. In this class we will explore how poetry\nspeaks to identity, speaks to history, and speaks intersections of race,\ngender, sexuality, tragedy, triumph, and trauma. We will read poetry –\nmostly contemporary poets, mostly female-identiﬁed poets, mostly\npoets of color, and mostly poets from the margins – read theories on\npoetry, and maybe try our hand at a little poetry writing.

Description and interpretation of nature has shaped artistic\nrepresentation from the very beginning of human history. We will\nlook at indigenous narratives, at activist texts, and at writing and\nimages from the Americas in relation to selected European works,\nmoving from Crevecoeur’s “Letters from an American Farmer” (1765)\nto excerpts from Wordsworth’s “Prelude” in England (1798), which\nin turn influenced Emerson’s essay “Nature” (1836) and Thoreau’s\nwriting in Walden and “Civil Disobedience” (1851). Twentieth century\nworks include selections from John Steinbeck’s The Grapes of Wrath\n(1939); Rachel Carson’s “Silent Spring” (1962); and John McPhee’s\n“Encounters with the Archdruid” (1971). Painting, photography and\nﬁlms will be included, with images from the Hudson River School,\nphotographs of National Parks, and contemporary environmental ﬁlms.\nAn essential element is the study of activist organizations alongside\ninternational collaborations (COP27), the UN Sustainable Development\nGoals, and issues of environmental justice.

What makes a\nfriendship good or bad? What tensions or correspondences might\nwe trace between friendship and adjacent categories of relationality\n—’frenemies,’ sisterhood, lovers? In this course, we will apply close\nanalytical examinations of literary and cultural texts in order to theorize\nthe various shapes friendship may take. Throughout the semester, we\nwill question how the friendships we encounter are situated within\nand/or against a variety of cultural and socioeconomic contexts. In\ndoing so, we will explore friendship’s conceptual role in narratives\nof emotional development, education and intellectual life, work,\ncommunity, and domesticity. Literary and theoretical texts may include\nworks by Jane Austen, Toni Morrison, Kamila Shamsie, Kali Fajardo-\nAnstine, Jean Chen Ho, bell hooks, Virginia Woolf, Anahit Behrooz,\nRoxane Gay, Audre Lorde, and Adrienne Rich. Selections from ﬁlm and\ntelevision may include the tv dramatization of Elena Ferrante’s My\nBrilliant Friend and Keira Knightley’s portrayal of Georgiana Cavendish\nin The Duchess, among others.

Should pregnant people\nbe categorized as a 'vulnerable' population in medical research, for\ninstance, and how can race and/or disability status be factored into\nthese discussions in ways that support rather than erase marginalized\ngroups? Is trans-phobia the reason people were so dismissive of\nRachel Dolezal's claim to be Black, or is there a difference between\ngender and race that makes someone's claim to be transgendered\nquite different from Dolezal's claim to be transracial? If we could\neliminate disabilities in the womb, should we, or is that just another\nform of objectionable eugenics? To address these sorts of questions,\nwe'll need to talk about different views of what gender, race, and\ndisability are, as well as what people's experiences of how these\nidentities intersect tells us about power, prejudice, and pride. Readings\nwill include selections from Simone deBeauvoir's The Second Sex,\nCathy Park Hong's Minor Feelings: an Asian-American Reckoning,\nKwame Anthony Appiah's Color Conscious: The Political Morality of\nRace, the edited collection What is Race?: Four Philosophical Views,\nElizabeth Barnes's The Minority Body: A Theory of Disability, and Eva\nKittay's Learning from My Daughter: The Value and Care of Disabled\nMinds\nFYSB BC1766 American Exceptionalism. 3.00 points.\nIn this course we probe the ideology of American \"exceptionalism.\" We\ntreat the literary history of this idea as a transtemporal conversation\ninvolving its founding architects, ardent critics, and experimental\nreformers, concerned with the question of what should be valued on\nthe American continents and within American experience. We become\ncartographers of this conversation and interlocutors within it, as we\nexplore how habits of conceiving truth, power, and the relationship\nof human beings to the natural world have controlled what counts\nas exceptional and what ordinary.

An interpretation? An inheritance? A point of view? Is\nthe world a social and linguistic construct? If so, how many worlds\nare there? If Wittgenstein is right and every world ends at the limits\nof its language, then what lies beyond? What happens after the end?\nThis course will consider these questions by investigating the end\nof the world in a variety of texts and contexts from the fourteenth\ncentury to the present: as a recurrent literary theme, religious ﬁxation,\nphilosophical conundrum, source of endless entertainment, and spring\nof existential anxiety. Contrary to what the phrase portends, we will\nﬁnd that there is no singular “end” of the world. Worlds end all the time.\nWe therefore will approach the idea of the end as a question of ruins\nand remnants, an encounter with the void at the end of history, but\nalso as a site of new beginnings, of futures we have yet to imagine—\nor can only imagine, if this means to glimpse what might be beyond\nthe patterns of thought, belief, and action, the terms and conditions,\nthe very language of the decaying world we inhabit. Authors, texts, and\nother materials will include ﬁction by Giovanni Boccaccio, Daniel Defoe,\nand Jeff VanderMeer; plays by Samuel Beckett; ﬁlms including Eternal\nSunshine of the Spotless Mind, Aniara, Melancholia, and Manufactured\nLandscapes; and studies in cultural anthropology, environmental\nhumanities and radical ecologies\nSpring 2025: FYSB BC1767\nCourse\nNumber\nSection/Call\nNumber\nTimes/Location Instructor Points Enrollment\nFYSB 1767 001/00375 T Th 10:10am - 11:25am \n403 Barnard Hall\nNathan\nGorelick\n3.00 16/16\nFYSB 1767 002/00408 T Th 11:40am - 12:55pm \n403 Barnard Hall\nNathan\nGorelick\n3.00 13/16\nFYSB BC1768 Gender Outlaws. 3.00 points.\nThis course explores literary and historical ﬁgures who challenge\ngender norms and contravene laws about gender and sexuality.

We will expand our purview to examine how artists, writers,\nand thinkers have employed mystical approaches in their respective\ncreative processes, sometimes to a surprising degree. In addition, this\ncourse will invite personal reflection, storytelling, and creative work that\nre-envisions the ways that our lives can be enriched when engaged in\nthe process of tracing the mystic; i.e., viewing texts through a mystical\nlens.

How have forms of captivity challenged and constrained\npursuits of liberation? In this interdisciplinary ﬁrst-year seminar,\nstudents will examine a broad range of texts, including activist\nmanifestoes, audio podcasts, graphic novels, memoirs and letters,\nmoving-image media, and works of political theory. We will study\nprocesses of industrial change, political revolution, and social\nupheaval, and we will analyze freedom and captivity from the vantage\npoint of the colony and the liberated territory, the factory and the\nofﬁce, the home and the school, the farm and the prison, the dinner\nparty and the moving train.

You know you can’t be counted if\nyou don’t vote. In this class, the question is how will you— or should\nyou, be counted when you do.

We will explore how understandings\nof queerness have shifted across times and cultures, how queer\nsubjects (now and in the past) have negotiated dominant discourses\nof sexuality and gender, and how narratives of queerness in our course\ntexts intersect with other positionalities such as race, ethnicity, religion,\nand citizenship. Organized around three sections (queer pasts, queer\npresents and queer futures), the course will consider the following\nquestions: How has queerness been articulated and deﬁned at various\npoints in the past, especially outside of Western Europe and North\nAmerica, and how does this inform or change the way we view it today?\nWhat are some of the key preoccupations of queer writers and activists\nin our present day and how might we participate in their conversations?\nHow do we envision queer futures, and how can queer imaginings\nof the future allow us to think critically about our presents today?\nReadings are subject to change but will likely include a selection from\nthe following and more: ﬁction and poetry by Sappho, Emily Dickinson,\nAkwaeke Emezi, Irena Klepﬁsz, Alexis Pauline Gumbs; memoirs and\nessays by Carmen Maria Machado, Edafe Okporo, Kazim Ali; artwork by\nZanele Muholi, Salman Toor and Nilbar Gures, ﬁlms and documentaries\non various course topics, as well as critical theory by Michel Foucault,\nHeather Love and others\nFYSB BC1775 Impostors and Impersonators. 3.00 points.\nIn this class, we will look at the fascination and the fear we have about\nimpostors who construct false identities and impersonators who take\non the identity of someone else—from folk and fairy tales to popular\nshows like Inventing Anna and the Tinder Swindler to conversations\nabout identity deception in deep fakes and ChatGPT.

An important additional objective of the French\nDepartment is to encourage students to consider studying in France or\na Francophone country.\nIn regard to students’ linguistic competence, our speciﬁc goals are:\n1. To enable students to express themselves on a range of topics with\nan acceptable degree of fluency and accuracy.\n2. To facilitate their comprehension of a variety of texts (both from\nliterature and the media) written in French.\n3. To foster students’ conﬁdence in the possibility of their living and\nstudying in a French environment.\nIn the context of the language requirement (the ﬁrst and second years),\nthis implies a competence premised on students’ ability to achieve, by\nIntermediate French II, oral and written fluency. Students will be able\nto use all tenses in the indicative and subjunctive, to deploy pronouns\nappropriately and understand the expressive and grammatical utility\nof conjunctions, rhetorical devices, and so on. Students will have\nthe ability to write a cogent essay in French on a literary or cultural\ntopic, and will possess a vocabulary beyond basic French, including\nrhetorical and conceptual vocabulary. In the context of the major\nrequirement (the third and fourth years), students will progress to a\ngreater competence in French, including advanced speaking skills,\nparticularly in terms of discussing literary and cultural topics, and\nwriting extended analytical essays. The culmination of a student’s\nprogress is the one-semester cap stone experience in the spring\nsemester of the senior year, where she will write a substantial thesis on\na topic of her choice, supervised by senior members of the department,\nand defended before an appropriately selected committee.\nStudent Learning Outcomes\nStudents majoring in French are expected to satisfy the following\nlearning outcomes:\n• Read literary texts closely and critically (explication de texte).\n• Discuss complex ideas in French with satisfactory proﬁciency.\n• Write analytical papers in French using appropriate theoretical\nand exegetical on given literary or cultural topics with satisfactory\nproﬁciency.\n• Demonstrate knowledge of French literature and other cultural\nmaterials.\n• Engage fully with another culture in a variety of intellectually\nsophisticated ways, including close textual analysis.\n• Conduct original research on a literary or cultural topic culminating\nin a 30 page thesis. For students in the Translation and Literature\ntrack the ability to translate a 30 page text from French into English\naccompanied by an introduction to the work.\nPlacement Exams\nAll ﬁrst-year, transfer, and/or returning students who studied French\nprior to entering Columbia/Barnard must take the placement exam\nbefore taking any Barnard French courses. Questions about the exam\nshould be directed to the department chair.\nAdvanced Placement\nStudents entering Barnard in Fall 2016 and thereafter will receive\npoints of credit for Advanced Placement (AP) and International\nBaccalaureate (IB) credit, but these credits will not exempt students\nfrom General Education Requirements.

In the ﬁrst part of the semester we engage in a chronological\nstudy of how the language emerged from a fusion of late medieval\nLatin with Germanic dialects to become a strong national institution.\nThe development of the language is contextualized by consideration of\nthe social and political history of France.

However, the 17th\nCentury was also the century of women: women writers, women\nphilanthropists, and women intellectuals who led some of the most\ninfluential literary salons of their time. The presence and agency of\nwomen during that period had a major influence on the representation\nof women in literature.

The\nsurvey begins with an introduction to key elements of the comical\nin literature and ﬁlm, including slapstick, clowning, mime, or stunts.\nDiscussions revolve around the issue of how or whether humor is\nuniversally recognizable or whether it is regionally, historically, and\nculturally deﬁned. To shed light on this difﬁcult question we will\nconsider both historical and geographical settings. In close studies\nof popular ﬁlms and literary texts we will examine the characters’\nproclivities and discuss their gender-based perspectives as well as\nthe influence of racial, religious or age-related identities. Our weekly\nreadings—which include excerpts from major novels, selected scenes\nfrom ﬁlms as well as short stories--provide us with rich and instructive\nexamples of how eating habits, choice of food, calendrical events\n(holiday vs. weekday) may be related to the formation and expression\nof cultural identity. Romantic comedies reveal not only personal\npreferences and the joy of eating—they also signal collective taste\npatterns and indicate what kind of fantasies or constraints have\ngoverned the daily or festive dietary practices from the early 20th\nc. on. While the comical is ﬁrst and foremost represented in time-\nhonored genres such as comedies or jokes, we will concentrate on the\nmodern tradition in this course. This approach allows us to address\nthe social, political, and cultural issue of multiculturalism and to build\nbridges between individual text/ﬁlm and their historical contexts\nin the German-speaking countries. The emphasis of the course lies\non a critical investigation of how cultural identity is related to self-\nexpression and to physical interaction on the page, the stage or the\nscreen.

History means\nnot only the record of the past but also the discipline of investigating\nand interpreting the past. The study of history develops habits of\ncritical thinking and effective writing, as well as it cultivates the careful\nanalysis of various types of quantitative and qualitative evidence. It\nshould be of value not only to undergraduates who intend to pursue\nadvanced degrees in the ﬁeld, but also to students interested in\nexploring the diversity and complexity of the human past, even as they\nhone their analytical and expository skills.\nStudent Learning Outcomes\nStudents graduating with a major in History should be able to attain the\nfollowing objectives:\n• Use and evaluate primary materials through critical reading and\ninterpretation\n• Understand the difference between primary materials and\nsecondary materials\n• Use and evaluate secondary materials through critical reading and\ninterpretation\n• Develop critical writing skills\n• Gain exposure to theories and methods of historical study\n• Explore in depth and gain a good acquaintance with the history of a\ngeographic area, a period, or  a theme\nThe Senior Research Seminar\nThe senior research seminar, in which students write their senior\nessays (50-70 pages), represents the culmination of the undergraduate\nhistory major. Students should discuss tentative topics with their\nadvisers by the end of the junior year.

As Spain was losing its control over Europe and the Atlantic\nworld, a number of ambitious small states on the periphery of Europe\nset their sights on achieving imperial glory. By mid-century, The Dutch\nRepublic, England, and Sweden were the primary contenders. Each\nnation developed a sense of manifest destiny and dedicated scarce\nresources to establish an imperial presence, from which they could\nconquer the world. While the former two nations succeeded in creating\nvast empires, the latter enjoyed only a brief stint as a world power. This\nfailure had nothing to do with a lack of effort or moral considerations.\nThis course explores Sweden’s imperial efforts and investigates its\nfailures. It examines how military, political, religious, commercial, and\nscientiﬁc endeavors contributed to Sweden’s quest for riches and\nprominence. The seminar begins by discussing Sweden’s sudden\nmilitary success during the Thirty Years’ War and the consequent\nformation of a Baltic empire. We next investigate Sweden’s presence\non the west coast of Africa, where it built fort Carlsborg, and the east\ncoast of North America, where it founded New Sweden. While these\nventures failed relatively rapidly, Sweden continued to pursue a colonial\npresence through trade and the acquisition in 1784 of St. Barthélemy, a\ncolony from which they engaged in trade, including the slave trade\nHIST BC3177 Capitalism and Climate Change. 4.00 points.\nCurrent patterns of economic growth are no longer environmentally\nsustainable. Global industrialization and the associated transference of\ncarbon from the ground to the air are leading to a rapid exhaustion of\nresources and a warming of the planet. These changes have triggered\na set of dangerous climactic transformations that are likely to cause\nmassive ecological disruptions and disturbances of food production\nsystems. These changes, in turn, might have a profound impact on\npoverty, migration, and geopolitics. To better understand how we have\narrived at the present predicament, this seminar explores the history of\nhow social and economic theorists have conceptualized the interaction\nbetween the economy and nature. The focus will be on the concept of\nscarcity as a way of understanding the relationship between economic\ngrowth and environmental sustainability. The course begins in the\nRenaissance and traces the evolution of the nature/economy nexus to\nthe present", "source": "pdfs/barnard 2024-2025.pdf"}

Yet such\nconcept contrasted starkly with the reality of science in the interwar\nperiod and World War II, at the peak of the clash between liberal\ndemocracies and fascist dictatorships. What was the role of science\nin the global conflict between liberalism and the fascist ‘New Order’?\nWhat did science and technology look like under fascism? This class\nexamines the relationship between science and fascism in Fascist\nItaly, Nazi Germany, Franco’s Spain, and Salazar’s Portugal. During\nthe Great War (1914-1918), science and technology were enlisted\nas critical assets for the war effort and the international scientiﬁc\ncommunity was shattered across national lines. The Great War proved\nthe importance of the scientiﬁc organization of society and state-\ncontrolled scientiﬁc advancement. Fascism developed this lesson\nin the interwar period to pursue its nationalist and imperialist goal:\nthe creation of a new world order. Thus, the seminar explores the\nentanglement between science, technology and fascism by examining\na wide range of disciplines, such as physics, medicine, eugenics,\nstatistics, demography, agronomy, and engineering. Focusing in\nparticular on fascism’s central themes of race and empire, the course\nexamines the relationship between state power and scientiﬁc expertise,\nthe persecution of Jewish scientists in Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy,\nand scientists’ critical competition in World War II ahead of the creation\nof the atomic bomb, which ushered in the new era of the Cold War\nHIST BC3323 The City in Europe. 4 points.\nBC: Fulﬁllment of General Education Requirement: Historical Studies\n(HIS). \nNot offered during 2023-2024 academic year.\nPrerequisites: Permission of the instructor.

The Black Lives Matter movement\nhas extended still further, inciting communities across the globe to\nraise their voices against discrimination and inequality. Rather than\nviewing the United States— and the north Atlantic, more generally\n— through an exceptionalist lens, this seminar draws on the strong\ntransnational resonance of the Black Lives Matter movement and\nthe compelling responses of global communities across distinct\ndemographics and colonial histories to decenter the historical origins\nof race thinking and provincialize its conceptual centrality as a ﬁrst\nstep in understanding its reach and relevance as a global signiﬁer\nof “difference” today. How might we develop critical studies of race\nand racism that are truly global and extend beyond the historical\nexperience of the North Atlantic, and North America in particular?\nMight we consider the concept history of race, commonly associated\nwith the Atlantic World and plantation slavery as a form of historical\ndifference proximate to other practices of social hierarchy and\ndistinction across the modern world? How can scholarship that\naddresses questions of black vitality, fugitivity and Afropessimism\nengage productively and rigorously with questions of colonial servitude\nand postcolonial sovereignty that emanates from anticaste thought,\nideas of Islamic universality, Pan-Africanism, or heterodox Marxisms?\nAn exercise in comparative thinking, this seminar will function as\nan interstitial home for intellectual engagements in both the Global\nSouth and North, excavating linkages between injustices perpetrated\nthrough divisions of race, caste, and minority status, as well as the\nconceptual innovations born from struggles against them. We are\nexplicitly focused on the relationship between worldmaking and\nconcept formation. Questions of historical comparison and conceptual\nconvergence are important. So, too the forms of sociopolitical\nsolidarity and political utopias that have arisen as a consequence of\nstruggles against enslavement and imperialism. Every seminar session\nwill open with a twenty-minute discussion about political and social\nhistorical contexts.

R. AMBEDKAR\nAT COLUMBIA. 4.00 points.\nB. R. Ambedkar is arguably one of Columbia University’s most\nillustrious alumni, and a democratic thinker and constitutional lawyer\nwho had enormous impact in shaping India, the world’s largest\ndemocracy. As is well known, Ambedkar came to Columbia University\nin July 1913 to start a doctoral program in Political Science. He\ngraduated in 1915 with a Masters degree, and got his doctorate from\nColumbia in 1927 after having studied with some of the great ﬁgures of\ninterwar American thought including Edwin Seligman, James Shotwell,\nHarvey Robinson, and John Dewey. This course follows the model of\nthe Columbia University and Slavery course and draws extensively\non the relevant holdings and resources of Columbia’s RBML, [Rare\nBooks and Manuscript Library] Burke Library (Union Theological\nSeminar), and the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture\namong others to explore a set of relatively understudied links between\nAmbedkar, Columbia University, and the intellectual history of the\ninterwar period. Themes include: the development of the disciplines at\nColumbia University and their relationship to new paradigms of social\nscientiﬁc study; the role of historical comparison between caste and\nrace in producing new models of scholarship and political solidarity;\nlinks between ﬁgures such as Ambedkar, Lala Lajpat Rai, W. E. B.\nDu Bois and others who were shaped by the distinctive public and\npolitical culture of New York City, and more. This is a hybrid course\nwhich aims to create a ﬁnding aid for B. R. Ambedkar that traverses\nRBML private papers. Students will engage in a number of activities\ntowards that purpose. They will attend multiple instructional sessions\nat the RBML to train students in using archives; they will make public\npresentations on their topics, which will be archived in video form; and\nstuents will produce digital essays on a variety of themes and topics\nrelated to the course. Students will work collaboratively in small groups\nand undertake focused archival research. This seminar inaugurates\nan on-going, multiyear effort to grapple with globalizing the reach\nand relevance of B. R. Ambedkar and to share our ﬁndings with the\nColumbia community and beyond. Working independently, students will\ndeﬁne and pursue individual research projects.

The course draws on the convergent\nyet distinct urban trajectories of cities in the global South (Bangalore;\nBombay/Mumbai; Lahore; New Delhi; Dhaka) as an enabling location\nfor exploring broader questions of comparative and global urbanism\nfrom an explicitly South-South perspective. That is, we ask how distinct\nyet connected urban forms might force us to alter our approaches\nto the city; approaches that are largely drawn from modular Euro-\nAmerican paradigms for understanding urbanization as coeval with\nmodernity, as well as industrialization. We do so in this seminar\nby focusing on people and practices—subaltern urbanity (and on\nthose whose labor produced the modern city), as well as on spatial\norders—the informal or unintended city—to ask the question: “what\nmakes and unmakes a city?” How might questions about built form,\nindustrialization, capital flows, and social life and inhabitation that\ntakes the perspective of “city theory from the Global South” shed new\nunderstanding on the history of the city, the extranational frames of\ncolonial modernity, and the ongoing impact of neoliberalism?

{"page_index": 408, "page_content": "408  Human Rights Studies\nDepartment Email Address: humanrights@barnard.edu\nMission \nThe Human Rights Studies Program introduces Barnard\nundergraduates to the basic normative, theoretical and empirical\nknowledge and skills necessary to contribute cogently to public\ndebates and policy initiatives related to social justice in the modern\nworld.  This mission reflects the proliferation of human rights concerns\nand the associated growth of public and private human rights\ninstitutions over the past half century, but more importantly the\ndaunting theoretical and practical challenges that still remain.  Human\nRights Studies at Barnard is an interdisciplinary program, a joint\nmajor that combines the study of human rights with a complementary\ndisciplinary, regional or other expertise at the choice of each student.  \nThese options include but are not limited to Africana Studies, American\nStudies, Anthropology, Asian and Middle Eastern Cultures, Comparative\nLiterature, English, French, German, History, Italian, Political Science,\nPsychology, Religion, Slavic, Sociology, Spanish, and Women's Studies.\nStudent Learning Goals\nHuman rights learning objectives fall into four broad categories:\n• Competence with respect to the normative dimensions concerned\nwith social justice, and the related institutions.\n• Mastery of the empirical skills required to collect, evaluate and\nreport accurately data on human rights abuses and institutional\nactivities.\n• A basic knowledge of the causes and effects associated with\nhuman rights situations, including the factors that ameliorate or\naggravate violations.\n• An understanding of the factors that contribute to effective\nremedial or response strategies and take into account the different\npolitical, economic, social and cultural contexts of each set of\nproblems.\nStudent Learning Outcomes\nIn the case of undergraduate women majoring in human rights, these\nfour broad goals would require students to possess the following\nknowledge and skills. The capacity to:\n1. Identify, and understand the work of, the main public and private\ninstitutions that comprise the modern international human rights\nregime.\n2. Identify the main past and present currents of theory and practice\nthat deﬁne and challenge the contemporary consensus on human\nrights norms, particularly with respect to the core concepts of\ndiscrimination, equality, diversity, pluralism and human dignity.\n3. Identify and trace the impact of the major events over the last\nhundred years that have led to the formation of the contemporary\nhuman rights norms and institutions.\n4. Understand the major taxonomies, paradigms and current debates\nin the ﬁeld of international human rights.\n5. Exhibit competency in the integration of normative, institutional,\npublic policy and empirical materials.\n6. Understand the ways in which international standards are\nimplemented and enforced in both international and domestic fora,\nincluding the nature of the obligations on states and other national\nand international actors.\n7. Think and write critically about human rights institutions, theories,\nstrategies and their relationship to other social priorities.\n8. Discuss in detail two or more case studies, groups at risk, or\nspeciﬁc human rights problems such as public health, speciﬁc\nrights, refugees, indigenous people, poverty etc., incorporating\nas appropriate the resources of other Barnard departments and\nprograms.\n9. Identify the ways in which the human rights regime offers tools to\naddress violations of women’s human rights as well as the ways in\nwhich women have been influential in the ﬁeld.\n10. Examine the relationships between human rights paradigms and\nthose in related ﬁelds, notably development studies, peace and\nconflict management, security studies, social work, refugee and\nmigration studies and especially women’s studies.\n11. Complete and defend advanced original research that draws on\ndiverse sources and addresses one or more of the above questions.\nHuman rights studies at Barnard is designed to contribute to a liberal\narts curriculum.   Its cross-disciplinary character enriches and beneﬁts\nfrom Barnard’s teaching in the humanities and social sciences.  Its\ncore courses examine critically universally accepted intellectual and\npolitical frameworks for debates on social justice, i.e. international\nhuman rights law.  Many of these debates focus on domestic and\ninternational issues that are the grist of ongoing political and ethical\ndebates that are legitimately the concern of all citizens and for which\nthey ought to be well prepared.  As such, human rights studies forms\nan integral part of the expanding ﬁeld of international education at\nBarnard.  The Program draws on Columbia’s and NYC’s unique human\nand documentary resources.  It also provides an intellectual base and\nappropriate skills for social advocacy. These different dimensions\ndo not coincide with individual disciplines.  The range of issues that\nnow fall within the ﬁeld of human rights is extensive, reflecting the\nscope of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and its subsequent\nassociated treaties.  The unique and deﬁning dimensions of human\nrights studies are the problems raised by its normative and prescriptive\nor remedy-oriented dimensions (the ﬁrst and the fourth of the ﬁelds of\nstudy above).\nDirector: J.C.

New York has become\na particular flashpoint with a large influx of asylum seekers, most of\nthem from Latin America. Often, they have arrived on buses sent here\nby southern governors intending to make the border “problem” that\nof a so-called “sanctuary city.” How has New York responded? And\nhow does this ﬁt into the city’s long history of refuge? This course\nwill offer students an introduction to the theory, ethics, and history of\nthe idea of international protection. We will look speciﬁcally at how\nLatin American citizens have engaged with the US asylum system\nover time and how this engagement has changed the shape of US\nimmigration laws. We will study the origins of the ideas of international\nprotection, who is understood to qualify and why, how the system has\nchanged over time, and what these developments mean for a broader\nunderstanding of human rights across borders. We will also take a\ncritical look at asylum, examine ideas of deservingness and innocence\nand their intersection with categories of race, class and gender, and\nquestion what it means for certain people to be constructed as victims\nand others to be seen as not eligible – or worthy – of protection. This\nis an engaged pedagogy course. The class will be organized around\na close collaboration with a NY legal organization that has taken on\nthe work of representing many asylum seekers in the city.

With a backlog of over two million cases and\ncounting, judges have impossibly full dockets, cases get continued\nat the last minute, and many people are left to their own devices to\ntry to make sense of what their options might be to stay in the United\nStates. A key part of this confusion is because immigration court –\nthough the stakes of decisions are as high as can be – is civil, not\ncriminal. Given this, individuals are not guaranteed the right to a\ncourt appointed attorney. New York City, however, has been on the\nforefront of trying to remedy at least this part of the equation, piloting\na unique program to guarantee representation to New Yorkers facing\nremoval proceedings. While having access to an attorney can make a\nmeaningful difference, immigration judges still enjoy wide discretion in\nhow they decide a given case. The core idea of this course is that there\nis a real utility to observing immigration court, both for research and for\ncontributing to social change. This course will center around a practice\nof court watching in immigration court in order to develop a scholarly\nanalysis of systems, institutions, and the functioning (or not) of the\nlaw. At the same time, this court watching practice will also involve the\nsystematic collection of qualitative data that may be directly useful\nto immigration attorneys and their clients in their perpetual effort to\nhold immigration courts accountable and create as fair as possible\nof a playing ﬁeld that upholds the basic principles of human rights.\nTo that end, in this class we will study how to conduct courtroom\nobservations, drawing from different methodological approaches and\nﬁndings, study the idea, history, and critiques of immigration law from\nacross disciplines, and conduct extensive, in depth, immigration court\nwatching. We will partner with local legal services organizations in\norder to sharpen our sense of what kinds of data is useful for their\nspeciﬁc legal interventions and to ensure that the data that we do\ncollect and interpret can become part of a larger project to hold courts\naccountable.

In this course, you’ll learn (1) what\nconstitutes a sociology of human rights and (2) what sociology, its\nclassics, and its diverse methods bring to the empirical study and\ntheory of human rights. We’ll explore the history, social institutions\nand laws, ideas, practices, and theories of human rights. We’ll become\nfamiliar with the social actors, social structures, and relationships\ninvolved in practices such as violation, claims-making, advocacy, and\nprotection. We’ll consider how social, cultural, political, and economic\nforces affect human rights issues. We’ll learn about the questions\nsociologists ask, starting with the most basic (but far from simple)\nquestion, “what is a human right?” We’ll tackle key debates in the ﬁeld,\nconsidering – for instance – whether human rights are universal and\nhow human rights relate to cultural norms/values, national sovereignty,\nand national security. Finally, we’ll apply the concepts we’ve learned to\na wide range of issues (ex: how racial, ethnic, gender, and other social\ninequalities relate to human rights), rights (ex: LGBTQ rights, the rights\nof laborers, the rights of refugees), and cases (ex: enslavement, the\nseparation of children from their families, circumcision, sterilization,\nthe use of torture).

As a framework for articulating\nand pursuing justice at local, national, and global levels, human rights\nin the 21st century draw on the diverse histories of social movements,\nmoral philosophy, legal institutions, and political maneuvers across\nthe modern period. Claimed most frequently when their violation is\nmost egregious, the history of human rights is also a history of wrongs,\nwith the changing nature and scope of oppression serving to provoke\ndifferent kinds of human rights struggles. Often invoked as timeless\nand universal standards, the history of human rights demonstrates\ntheir basic malleability, both in terms of which rights are recognized\nand who qualiﬁes as human, and their fundamental contingency,\nboth in terms of the precariousness of any human rights ‘victory’\nand their potential for co-optation in the interests of power. Finally,\nwhile this course is primarily concerned with the history of human\nrights, we will also consider the human rights of history, reflecting\non the role of history and historical consciousness in the pursuit for\njustice.

We will pursue three lines of inquiry. The ﬁrst\ncritically explores how central political concepts of the international\nstate system—sovereignty, property, territory, self-determination—\nentwine the histories of settler colonialism and human rights. The\nsecond charts the rise and mechanisms of the international Indigenous\nrights movement, in particular its activity at the United Nations\nleading to the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples in\n2007, and its contributions to ongoing debates on environmental\nand climate justice, group rights, natural resources and territorial\nautonomy, and cultural rights. The third unit interrogates settler state\nresponses to the movement for Indigenous human rights, such as\ncooptation, recognition, and apology. Through readings drawn from\nhistory, ethnography, political and critical theory, international relations,\nNative studies, law, and documents produced by intergovernmental\norganizations and NGOs, we will explore and deepen the tensions\nbetween human rights as a theory and practice and the political lives\nand aspirations of Indigenous peoples and activists. What technologies\nof rule—such as residential school systems and property law—do\nsettler colonial states deploy to dispossess Indigenous peoples?\nHow have Indigenous peoples used the international human rights\nregime to mobilize against such dispossession? How have these states\nresisted the global Indigenous rights movement? And can the human\nrights regime, rooted in the international state system, meaningfully\ncontribute to anticolonial movements in liberal settler colonies? While\nwe will touch on settler colonialism as it manifests around the globe,\nthe course’s geographical focus will be on North America.

What forms of equality should be recognized to assure effective\nrights for all? What forms of identity should be recognized? Can there\nbe effective human rights without an intersectional approach? Should\nwe prioritize redistribution or recognition? What can we learn from\ncases developed in the UN System, in regional systems of human\nrights, and in speciﬁc countries in Asia, Africa, Latin America, North\nAmerica, and Europe?

And while\nnumbers are increasing, solutions are still elusive. The modern refugee\nregime, the collection of laws and institutions designed to address\nthe problems faced by refugees, has developed slowly over the course\nof the last 100 years, ﬁrst in response to speciﬁc crises. That regime\nhas been shaped by a changing geopolitical landscape. At the end of\nthe Cold War, institutions in the ﬁeld expanded their mandates and\npreferred solutions to the “problem” of refugees changed.

Can it be ﬁxed?\nThis course will largely focus on the issues of forced migration,\ndisplacement and refugees related to conflict, although this subject\nis inevitably intertwined with larger debates about citizenship and\nhumanitarianism. Taking an interdisciplinary perspective, this course\nwill address both scholarly and policy debates. Utilizing human rights\nscholarship, it will draw on work in history that charts the evolution of\ninstitutions; legal scholarship that outlines international and domestic\nlaws; work in political science that seeks to understand responses in\na comparative perspective, and anthropological studies that address\nhow refugees understand these institutions and their experiences of\nexile and belonging.

We cant talk about human rights without talking about the\nforms in which we talk about human rights. This course will study the\nconvergences of the thematics, philosophies, politics, practices, and\nformal properties of literature and human rights. In particular, it will\nexamine how literary questions of narrative shape (and are shaped\nby) human rights concerns; how do the forms of stories enable and\nrespond to forms of thought, forms of commitment, forms of being,\nforms of justice, and forms of violation? How does narrative help us\nto imagine an international order based on human dignity, rights, and\nequality? We will read classic literary texts and contemporary writing\n(both literary and non-literary) and view a number of ﬁlms and other\nmultimedia projects to think about the relationships between story\nforms and human rights problematics and practices. Likely literary\nauthors: Roberto Bolaño, Miguel de Cervantes, Assia Djebar, Ariel\nDorfman, Slavenka Drakulic, Nuruddin Farah, Janette Turner Hospital,\nFranz Kafka, Sahar Kalifeh, Sindiwe Magona, Maniza Naqvi, Michael\nOndaatje, Alicia Partnoy, Ousmane Sembène, Mark Twain . . . .

The announcement indicated a new era in the earth’s\nchronology marked by the consequences of human activity on the\nplanet’s ecosystems. Closely related to discussions of sustainability,\ninvestigations into the Anthropocene tend to focus on environmental\nand ecological issues while ignoring its social justice dimensions. This\ncourse will investigate how Human Rights has and will be impacted by\nthe Anthropocene, with special attention paid to the human dimensions\nand consequences of anthropogenic change. Do new and troubling\nrevelations about anthropogenic mistreatment of the earth and its\nresources modify or amplify the kinds of responsibilities that govern\nactivity between individuals and communities? How do we scale\nthe human response from the urban, to the periurban, to the rural?\nHow must the study of Human Rights evolve to address violence\nand mistreatment associated not just among humans but also amid\nhuman habitats? What sorts of juridical changes must occur to\nrecognize and respond to new manifestations of social injustice that\nrelate directly to consequences of anthropogenic changes to the\nEarth system? Topics will include discussions of the Environmental\nJustice movement, agribusiness, access to (and allocation of)\nnatural resources, population growth; its global impact, advocacy\nfor stronger and more accountability through environmental legal\nchange, biodiversity in urban environments, and the growing category\nof environmental refugees\nFall 2024: HRTS GU4600\nCourse\nNumber\nSection/Call\nNumber\nTimes/Location Instructor Points Enrollment\nHRTS 4600 001/10645 T 10:10am - 12:00pm \n613 Hamilton Hall\nNoah Chasin 3.00 14/22\nHRTS 4600 AU1/18840 T 10:10am - 12:00pm \nOthr Other\nNoah Chasin 3.00 4/4", "source": "pdfs/barnard 2024-2025.pdf"}

Open to 3rd\nand 4th year undergraduates on ﬁrst day of term with the instructor's\npermission.\nThe resurgence of religion over the past three decades has had\na transformative influence globally and within nations. Religious\nnationalism, fundamentalism, and communalism have arisen to\nforcefully compete with secular democracy. With the fall of the Soviet\nbloc and the bilateralism of the Cold War, ethnic particularism, often\nof a religious character, has emerged as the locus of identity for\npeople on all continents. These rapid changes engendered by a new,\noften commanding, role for religion challenge the very concept of\nindividual and universal human rights. They raise difﬁcult theoretical\nand painfully practical questions as to the preservation of individual\nhuman rights, and the relationship of democracy to religion. At the\nsame time, recent currents such as economic globalization, the\ntriumph of the free market, and the communications revolution\npromote individual autonomy, a cornerstone of human rights. There\ncan be no doubt that religion will occupy an increasingly salient role\nin the social and political life of nations during the course of the 21st\ncentury. The relevance of religion to human rights in our time cannot\nbe undervalued.

Whatever\nfaith we have in human rights to either secure or remake the world\nhas had good reason to be shaken—or was unfounded from the\nstart. Indeed, since universal rights were proposed there have been\nskeptics, questioning their abstraction, insufﬁciency, Eurocentrism,\nand overreach, among other shortcomings. When it comes to critiquing\nhuman rights, is there anything left to be said? This seminar course\nconsiders where the human rights idea and project goes from here.\nStarting rather than ending with these critiques, we will pursue\ntheoretical and practical attempts to reimagine human rights in their\nlight. How have commentators drawn on liberal, pragmatic, radical\ndemocratic, and anticolonial thought to forge a vision of human rights\nmade to the measure of a world in crisis? What are the value and limits\nof critique in the human rights project? And how do theory and praxis\nrelate in attempts to reconstruct human rights beyond these critiques?\nIn pursuit of answers, we will read political theory, history, philosophy,\nand ethnography, as well as together assemble an archive of already\nexisting projects to reformulate, resignify, and mobilize human rights in\nnovel directions\nSpring 2025: HRTS GU4850\nCourse\nNumber\nSection/Call\nNumber\nTimes/Location Instructor Points Enrollment\nHRTS 4850 001/17298 Th 2:10pm - 4:00pm \n569 Alfred Lerner Hall\nTimothy\nWyman-\nMcCarthy\n3.00 16/22", "source": "pdfs/barnard 2024-2025.pdf"}

Although its founding was\ngrounded in fundamental norms of inalienable rights, equality and\nfreedom, U.S. history is characterized by divisive and sometimes\nviolent disagreements about who counts as human, what is\nfundamental to the human condition, and which/how rights should\nbe protected. How has this history contributed to our contemporary\nstruggles? Through engaging with issues related to racial justice,\ncriminal justice, reproductive justice, disability justice, gender justice,\nand indigenous people’s rights, students are asked to consider how\ncertain rights are sites of contestation within the U.S. political system\nand within U.S. society. This course offers a multidisciplinary survey\nof urgent contemporary human rights issues in the United States\nand seeks to advance students’ skills to examine human rights\nresearch and analysis through intersectional approaches. Part of the\ninquiry of this course is ensuring that students understand existing\ntensions among several key concepts (1) human rights as a body\nof international human rights law and institutions; (2) human rights\nmovements using human rights discourse to further their aspirations;\n(3) constitutional rights in the U.S. as interpreted by U.S. courts that\nmay or may not allude to/be contained in international law; and (4)\npolitical rhetoric that use the language of “rights” for political ends.\nCoursework will ground current human rights debates in their social,\nlegal, and political contexts.

About 50 per cent of the estimated 26 million people\ncurrently displaced by armed conflicts and violence are children.\nThis course examines global approaches, challenges and problems\nassociated with providing resources, implementing laws and\nguidelines, and ensuring education to children before, during and\nafter armed conflicts. Students will be asked to interrogate current\napproaches and literature in light of critical theories of childhood,\nhuman rights and children’s rights more speciﬁcally.  The course\nutilizes case studies that show the failures of international human\nrights and NGOs to address the needs of children before, during, and\nafter conflict, as well as the problems with not taking into account\nchildren’s perspectives and lived experience. The course seeks to the\nextent possible to incorporate children’s views on conflict through a\nreview of children’s drawings, writing, and interviews.  It questions the\ncommon representations about children and armed conflict that mass\nmedia, international development literature, children’s literature, and\nﬁlm promote. The course will also explore the international norms for\nprotecting children in emergencies which have also been strengthened\nconsiderably, by a number of UN Security Council resolutions, notably\nresolutions 1612 and 1820, aimed at ending the abuse of children\nand civilians in the context of war. What are the responsibilities\nof the International Community to protect and support children of\nwar? What preventative measures can be taken to better ensure\nchildren do not fall victims to armed conflict?  Finally, the course\ntakes a special look at education prior to, during conflict, and post-\nconflict, to understand how and whether the root causes of conflict--\ndiscrimination, intolerance, economic inequality-- are addressed by\neducational systems.", "source": "pdfs/barnard 2024-2025.pdf"}

We will attend to the solidity and fragility of geographic\ndivisions (regional and trans regional conflicts), their history (modern /\npremodern, colonial / pre- and post-colonial), the emergence of race\n(racial and ethnic conflicts), the pertinence of religions (religious\nstrife and violence), their relation to political associations (religion\nand politics, religion and nationalism) and to other social and/or\neconomic divisions (class, gender). We will interrogate the analytic\nand descriptive value of keywords like war, enmity, dispute, division,\npartition.

As a result,\nenvironmental history places at center stage a wide range of previously\noverlooked historical actors such as plants, animals, and diseases.\nMoreover, by locating nature within human history, environmental\nhistory encourages its practitioners to rethink some of the fundamental\ncategories through which our understanding of the natural world is\nexpressed: wilderness and civilization, wild and tame, natural and\nartiﬁcial. For those interested in the study of ethnicity, environmental\nhistory casts into particularly sharp relief the ways in which the natural\nworld can serve both to undermine and to reinforce the divisions within\nhuman societies. Although all human beings share profound biological\nsimilarities, they have nonetheless enjoyed unequal access to natural\nresources and to healthy environments—differences that have all-too-\nfrequently been justiﬁed by depicting such conditions as “natural.”\nHIST BC2401 PLTCS CRIME# POLICING IN U.S.. 3.00 points.\nThis course will examine the historical development of crime and\nthe criminal justice system in the United States since the Civil War.\nThe course will give particular focus to the interactions between\nconceptions of crime, normalcy and deviance, and the broader social\nand political context of policy making\nFall 2024: HIST BC2401\nCourse\nNumber\nSection/Call\nNumber\nTimes/Location Instructor Points Enrollment\nHIST 2401 001/00027 M W 6:10pm - 7:25pm \nLl002 Milstein Center\nMatthew Vaz 3.00 66/60\nAHIS UN2425 Visual Activism. 4.00 points.\nHow has visual culture played a role within the social movements of\nthe last several decades, such as #BlackLivesMatter and Extinction\nRebellion?

The class\nwill begin by examining the urban and rural water cycles, how water\nmoves through the environment and then how individuals obtain\ndrinking water. The emphasis will be on water quality and what\nimpacts water quality. The second section will focus on understanding\ntypes of sanitation, how they work, and how they can be improved.\nApproximately half the population in the global south is without\nimproved sanitation and infrastructure throughout high income\ncountries needs updating and replacing. The third section will examine\nall types of water contaminants including: anthropogenic, geogenic,\nand microbial. This will include an introduction to public health\nand epidemiological studies and how different contaminants can\nimpact health. The ﬁnal portion of the class will integrate the three\nareas to understand how they interact and how interventions can\nimprove health outcomes. We will use case studies from the US, Africa,\nSoutheast Asia, and Latin America\nFall 2024: EESC BC3043\nCourse\nNumber\nSection/Call\nNumber\nTimes/Location Instructor Points Enrollment\nEESC 3043 001/00865 M W 1:10pm - 2:25pm \n207 Milbank Hall\nBrian Mailloux 3.00 12/35\nECON BC3049 Economic Evaluation of Social Programs. 3 points.\nNot offered during 2023-2024 academic year.\nPrerequisites: ECON BC3035 Intermediate Micro Theory and ECON\nBC2411 Statistics for Economics, or the equivalents\nA study of the effectiveness of social programs and the different\nquantitative techniques economists use to evaluate policy\ninterventions.

This course will investigate\nthe conditions of mass incarceration in America by centering the\nmunicipal jail. Taking as objects of study both the jail itself and\nthe practice of incarcerating people in local jails, this course will\ncombine scholarly work on U.S. criminal justice with a variety of non-\nacademic texts including legal decisions, contemporary journalism, and\ndocumentary ﬁlm.

At the\nsame time, what exactly nonviolence is and what it can accomplish\nin politics is very much under debate. This course aims to understand\nthe politics of nonviolence by examining the political ideas and\npolitical careers of its most well-known twentieth-century advocates,\nM.K. Gandhi and Martin Luther King, Jr. Though still venerated as\nfounding ﬁgures of nonviolent protest, Gandhi and King have come to\nbe remembered in ways that can misconstrue how they understood\nand practiced nonviolent politics. To many, Gandhi is a saintly idealist,\nwho wanted to imbue politics with the spirit of ahimsa, truth, and\nconscience. Likewise, King is taken to be a spokesman for interracial\nbrotherhood and Christian love. While partly true, these images also\ndownplay the political side of their nonviolence – the techniques\nof organizing and strategies of protest that made their movements\nsuccessful. We will examine the evolution of Gandhi’s and King’s\npolitical thinking in relation to the movements they led – the Indian\nindependence movement and the civil rights movement in the US. We\nwill consider how the theory and practice of nonviolence evolved and\nchanged as it moved from one context to another. We will be especially\nfocused on understanding the dynamics of nonviolent protest\nPOLS UN3122 Citizenship, Rights, and Immigration. 3 points.\nOur political discourse is inundated with talk of citizenship. In this\ncourse we will examine various theories of citizenship, paying\nparticular attention to the way the increasing complexity and\nmulticulturalism of societies have challenged our understanding\nof this concept. We will also consider how different conceptions of\ncitizenship address the challenges raised by both global and local\nforces. After an overview of different theories of citizenship, we explore\nthe debates about political rights and representation for oppressed\ngroups and minorities and consider the nationalist and cosmopolitan\nunderstandings of civic identity. What should be the criteria for\ncitizenship? What rights should citizens have? Does citizenship require\nboundaries? Does democratic citizenship demand a particular kind\nof patriotism? What rights should illegal immigrants have? What role\ndoes the court play in deﬁning citizenship rights? Can there be global or\ntransnational citizenship? Though the primary focus will be to explore\nnormative theories of citizenship, we will briefly consider how the\nEuropean Union and the United States are dealing with some of the\npressing issues regarding citizenship: immigration and assimilation.\nWMST UN3125 INTRO TO SEXUALITY STUDIES. 3.00 points.\nThis course is designed to introduce major theories sexuality, desire\nand identity. We will be considering the relations between the history\nof sexuality and the politics of gender. We will read some primary texts\nin gender theory, and in the study of sexuality, desire, and embodiment.\nThis course also provides an introduction to the interdisciplinary\nexamination of human sexual and erotic desires, orientations, and\nidentities. We will study how desires are constructed, how they vary\nand remain the same in different places and times, and how they\ninteract with other social and cultural phenomena such as government,\nfamily, popular culture, scientiﬁc inquiry, and, especially, race and class.\nMDES UN3131 Crisis and War in the Horn of Africa. 3.00 points.\nThe Horn of Africa is often described as a disaster story, a land\nof terror, crisis and failure. But is it really a place in crisis? In what\nways and for whom? For the people of the region, what constitutes\nmeaningful social and political life? Is it possible to approach politics\nin the Horn of Africa through lenses other than those of violence and\ndisaster? Are there other methods of understanding the experiences of\ncrisis and recovery? In addition to examining emerging research trends\nin the region the course examines various approaches to the questions\nof war, humanitarian intervention, peace building, democratization,\nand economic reform. It considers how the study of popular culture,\nreligious change, and social movements provide other ways to think\nabout collective life. The seminar is intended for those interested in the\nstudy of Africa and the Middle East, and other regions that may seem\nbleak to outsiders but can provide new ways of understanding politics\nWMST BC3131 WOMEN AND SCIENCE. 4.00 points.\nPrerequisites: Enrollment limited to 18 students. \nPrerequisites: Enrollment limited to 18 students.

This course\naims to expand this discourse by incorporating the often-overlooked\nlens of technological mediation. Beginning with the premise that\nromantic love is deeply shaped by the affordances of the technology\nof the time, a critical awareness of technological mediation in romance\n–especially of digital technologies, i.e. online dating, social media, or\ncybersex— allows for a deeper understanding of how social categories\nsuch as gender, race, class, ability, or sexuality are technologically-\nmediated, thereby informing our societal and cultural perceptions of\nlove, dating, and sex.

In this course, we\nwill put abortion into multiple contexts (historical, political, legal,\npharmaceutical, religious), drawing interdisciplinary material from\nscholars, activists, community organizers, lawyers, care providers,\nand journalists. Each class will feature a guest speaker who has\ndedicated their career to advocating for abortion as a critical part of\noverall reproductive healthcare in the United States and internationally.\nGrounded in the reproductive justice framework, which aims not\nonly to protect the “right to choose” but also to create the economic,\nsocial, and environmental conditions in which people can parent with\ndignity, we will think of abortion as one critical part of a constellation of\nprojects that, together, work toward total reproductive freedom\nSOCI BC3236 Arab New York. 3.00 points.\nArab New York introduces students to a little-known community with\na long history in New York City dating back to the late 1800s.

In recent years, the\nidea of the Anthropocene—the period of geological time during which\nhuman activity has become the primary force shaping the Earth’s\nclimate—has abounded in both academic and popular literature. This\nfocus on human agency over the climate raises questions about\nthe extent to which humans share equally responsibility for and\nvulnerability to climate change, as well as differing understandings\nof human relationships and responsibilities toward the environment.\nThis course uses religion as a lens to examine the role of humans in\nboth creating ecological destruction and efforts to repair and rework\nrelationships with the natural world. We will draw on primary texts\nfrom religious traditions around the world in a bid to unsettle human-\ncentric and universalist narratives of the Anthropocene.

These links\nalso reach back in history to global wars of empire and colonial rule,\nrace relations during and following the collapse of the institution of\nslavery, and contemporary drug wars being waged across the Western\nHemisphere and other parts of the world. Today, the dynamics and\nconsequences of the politics of illicit drugs touch all our lives in\ndifferent ways, including individual and family struggles with substance\nabuse, everyday encounters with militarized police, and the strains\non democracy and citizenship, among many others. This course will\nexamine some of these dynamics and consequences with a theoretical\nand empirical focus mainly on Latin America and the United States.\nThroughout our time together we will connect these pressing issues\nto broader theories, concepts and empirical ﬁndings in political\nscience. The course is divided into several individual modules (denoted\nbelow with the headings A – G) under three overarching themes for\nthis semester: 1. Politics of Drugs in a Historical Perspective: The\nﬁrst theme is a broad historical overview of the political origins of\nillicit drugs and the global drug regime. Some of the main questions\nwe will tackle are: When and why did states label drugs as illicit?\nHow did domestic and global politics come together to shape the\nglobal drug regime and the “war on drugs?” What role did race and\ngender play in the early social construction of illicit drugs? 2. Illicit\nDrugs, Politics and Governance: The second theme focuses on\ncontemporary linkages between illicit drugs, violence, and politics.\nHere we will examine the conditions under which illicit drug markets\nare either violent or (relatively) peaceful. We will tackle questions\nlike: Do states always seek to dismantle drug markets? What is the\nrelationship between illicit drugs and electoral politics? What role\ndo illicit drugs play in governance by armed non-state actors? Are\nstates and criminal actors involved in the drug trade always at “war”\nwith each other? 3. Democracy, Citizenship, and the War on Drugs:\nThe third and ﬁnal theme centers on the political consequences\nof the war on drugs for questions of democracy and citizenship in\nthe Western Hemisphere. Some of the questions that will help us\nmake sense of these consequences are: How does the war on drugs\nimpact democracy and citizenship? What is the political economy of\nimprisonment? And in what ways do imprisonment and police-citizen\ninteractions – stemming from the war on drugs – shape individual and\ncollective political behavior and political subjectivity?\nAFRS BC3585 POOR IN AMERICA: THE EXPERIENCE AND IMPACT OF\nFINANCIAL DEPRIVATION. 4.00 points.\nThis course focuses on the life experiences and impact of poverty\nin the contemporary United States.

A\nsole focus on the present and future of the climate crisis obscures\na deeper understanding of how the crisis came to be.

The course will trace critical aspects of\nthese two major, interconnected historical phenomena with an eye to\nhow speciﬁc cases either manifested or troubled broader trends across\nvarious slaveholding societies. The ﬁrst half of the course addresses\nthe history of slavery and the second half pertains to experiences\nin emancipation.

We will pay special\nattention to the ways in which students class, race/ethnicity and\ngender shape their educational experiences. We will also look at how\nschools are organized, how schools construct differences among\nstudents, and how schools sort kids into different (and unequal)\ngroups. Finally we will explore the types of interventions - at both the\nindividual and organizational levels - that can mitigate inequality in\neducational achievement and help low-income students to succeed.\nOne such intervention that has shown promise is tutoring in academic\nand social and behavioral skills, and interventions that strengthen self-\nafﬁrmation. A major component of this class is your experience as a\ntutor.

We will draw upon a variety\nof interdisciplinary literatures—including feminist, critical race, and\nqueer studies; science and technology studies; disability studies; and\nmedical sociology and anthropology—to consider some of the ways in\nwhich our bodies have served as both the repository and substratum of\nrecent social transformations.

Scholar activists like Angela\nDavis, Ruth Gilmore and Mariame Kaba have long contended that\nthe abolition of slavery was but one ﬁrst step in ongoing abolitionist\npractices dismantling racialized systems of policing, surveillance\nand incarceration. The possibilities of prison and police abolition\nhave recently come into the mainstream national consciousness\nduring the 2020 resurgence of nationwide Black Lives Matters (BLM)\nprotests. As we collectively imagine what nonpunitive and supportive\ncommunity reinvestment in employment, education, childcare, mental\nhealth, and housing might look like, medicine must be a part of these\nconversations. Indeed, if racist violence is a public health emergency,\nand we are trying to bring forth a “public health approach to public\nsafety” – what are medicine’s responsibilities to these social and\ninstitutional reinventions? Medicine has a long and fraught history of\nracial violence. It was, after all, medicine and pseudoscientiﬁc inquiry\nthat helped establish what we know as the racial categorizations of\ntoday: ways of separating human beings based on things like skin\ncolor and hair texture that were used (and often continue to be used)\nto justify the enslavement, exclusion, or genocide of one group of\npeople by another. Additionally, the history of the professionalization\nof U.S. medicine, through the formation of medical schools and\nprofessional organizations as well as and the certiﬁcation of trained\nphysicians, is a history of exclusion, with a solidiﬁcation of the identity\nof “physician” around upper middle class white masculinity. Indeed,\nthe 1910 Flexner Report, whose aim was to make consistent training\nacross the country’s medical schools, was explicit in its racism. From\npractices of eugenic sterilization, to histories of experimentation upon\nbodies of color, medicine is unfortunately built upon racist, sexist and\nable-ist practices. This course is built on the premise that a socially\njust practice of medicine is a bioethical imperative. Such a practice\ncannot be achieved, however, without examining medicine’s histories\nof racism, as well as learning from and building upon histories of anti-\nracist health practice. The ﬁrst half of the semester will be dedicated\nto learning about histories of medical racism: from eugenics and racist\nexperimentation to public health xenophobic fear mongering. The\nsecond half of the semester will be dedicated to examining medical\nand grassroots anti-racist practices: from the free health clinics and\nhospital takeovers of the Black Panther and Young Lords Parties, to\nenvironmental activism in Flint and the Sioux Rock Reservation to\nantiracist AIDS and COVID activism", "source": "pdfs/barnard 2024-2025.pdf"}

The intention was to\ncreate a shocking visual spectacle, laying on the line “white coats\nfor black lives.” The images were all over social media: students of\nall colors, dressed in lab coats, lying prone against eerily clean tile\nfloors, stethoscopes in pockets, hands and around necks. One prone\nstudent held a sign reading, “Racism is Real.” These medical students’\ncollective protests not only created visual spectacle, but produced a\ndynamic speculative ﬁction. What would it mean if instead of Michael\nBrown or Eric Garner or Freddie Gray, these other, more seemingly\nelite bodies were subjected to police violence? In another viral image,\na group of African American male medical students from Harvard\nposed wearing hoodies beneath their white coats, making clear that\nthe bodies of some future doctors could perhaps be more easily\ntargeted for state-sanctioned brutality. “They tried to bury us,” read a\nsign held by one of the students, “they didn’t realize we were seeds.”\nBoth medicine and racial justice are acts of speculation; their practices\nare inextricable from the practice of imagining. By imagining new\ncures, new discoveries and new futures for human beings in the face of\nillness, medicine is necessarily always committing acts of speculation.\nBy imagining ourselves into a more racially just future, by simply\nimagining ourselves any sort of future in the face of racist erasure,\nsocial justice activists are similarly involved in creating speculative\nﬁctions. This course begins with the premise that racial justice is the\nbioethical imperative of our time. It will explore the space of science\nﬁction as a methodology of imagining such just futures, embracing\nthe work of Asian- and Afroturism, Cosmos Latinos and Indigenous\nImaginaries.

Inside the Situation Room, co-taught by Secretary Hillary\nRodham Clinton and Dean Keren Yarhi-Milo, employs insights from\ndiverse academic ﬁelds—including political psychology, domestic\npolitics, and international relations—and the direct experience of\nhigh-level principals in the room to understand the key factors which\nunderpin a nation’s most crucial decisions. This course allows students\nto engage with a range of case studies and examine decision-making\nin a variety of historical and contemporary contexts, from the search\nfor Osama bin Laden, to the “red line” in Syria, to negotiating with Iran.\nStudents will be taught how to analyze and understand the complex\ninterplay between individual psychology, domestic politics, public\nopinion, bureaucracy, the international environment, and other factors\nwhich feed into decisions about foreign policy—from crisis diplomacy\nto the use of force, signaling and perception, intelligence and its\nanalysis, the deployment of other instruments of statecraft, and more.\nThrough this course, students will think carefully and analytically about\nhow leaders and other actors view the world, how they arrive at their\ndecisions, and how various social, political, and psychological factors\nshape the policies they devise to promote their interests abroad.

In this course we examine Petrarch as\nhe fashions himself authorially, especially in the context of Ovid, Dante,\nand previous lyric poets. We bring to bear ideas on time and narrative\nfrom authors such as Augustine and Ricoeur in order to reconstruct\nthe metaphysical signiﬁcance of collecting fragments in what was\neffectively a new genre.

Special attention will be paid to the\nresponse of the novelistic discourse to modernity, and to Italy's\npeculiarly peripheral position in the modern world. Primary texts will be\nread in Italian, while theoretical references will be in English.\nITAL GU4395 Fifty Years of Impatience: The Italian Novel between\n1950-2000. 3 points.\nThe course examines some of the most important novels that belong to\nItaly's period of major social and economic transformations.

Such accelerated\nprogress, though,causes deep social instability and mobility which\nobviously results in heavy psychological pressures on the people:\nadaptation becomes crucial and inevitable. Fiction therefore resumes\nthe task to represent such awkwardness of integration into a modern\nbourgeois society that, contrarily to its European and American\ncounterpart, is extremely tentative and insecure per se, since it's\npolitical identity has extremely precarious grounds. Among other\nauthors, primary readings include Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa's\nThe Leopard and Italo Calvinos's If on a Winter's Night a Traveler.\nPrimary Readings in Italian.", "source": "pdfs/barnard 2024-2025.pdf"}

The purpose of\nthe program is to help the student identify resources for constructing\nrigorously detailed and methodological majors.\nThe program begins from the assumption that a meaningful major can\nbe most proﬁtably framed in one of the existing departments-such as,\nbut not limited to, American Studies, Ancient Studies, Anthropology,\nArt History, Asian and Middle Eastern Cultures, Classics, Comparative\nLiterature, English, History, Music, Religion, Sociology, and Women's\nStudies. The program director would then certify that the subject\nmatter of that major contains enough interest in Jewish subjects and is\nrigorous enough in methodology.\nFaculty at Barnard and Columbia who teach courses in Jewish Studies\nInclude:\nChair: Beth A.

Where courses in Jewish Studies also satisfy\ndepartmental major requirements, the student must complete at least\nthree courses in Jewish Studies over and above what is required for\nthe other major. Students are encouraged to consult the offerings of\nother relevant departments and frame a major by centering on the\nmethodological requirements of that major and utilizing the advising\ncapacities of that department. Students, especially those who plan\nto continue in graduate Jewish Studies of any kind, are strongly\nencouraged to seek competence in Hebrew and other languages\nwhich were used by Jews in their particular area of concentration.\nWhere possible, the courses in Jewish Studies should be taken across\nthe major areas of Jewish history: Ancient (biblical); Hellenistic and\nTalmudic; Medieval; and Modern. Besides the six courses speciﬁcally in\nJewish Studies, students must submit a Senior Thesis or project in the\narea of Jewish Studies, written in the major department.\nFor a complete list of faculty and courses visit the Columbia University\nInstitute for Israel and Jewish Studies.\nRequirements for the Minor\n--RELI UN2306 INTRO TO JUDAISM \n--Four additional courses in Jewish Studies\nA Jewish Studies minor comprises ﬁve courses in Jewish Studies\n(minimum 15 credits).

The ﬁrst historical event coincides with the creation\nof architecture of a bewildering scale while the second reflects the\nend of building without architectural treatises or architectural theory\n- in a modern sense. The course will also introduce students to new\ndigital technologies such as laser scanning and photogrammetry\nfor the study of medieval architecture. No preliminary knowledge of\nmedieval history or architectural history is needed, and no knowledge\nof digital technologies or speciﬁc computer skills is expected. The\nmonuments selected belong to a period that starts when architecture\nmoved away from Roman antique models and ends just before\nthe re-adoption of Classical standards in the Renaissance. In this\ncourse the originality of medieval architecture, its relationship with\nearlier and later monuments, and the dramatic effort involved in its\ncreation will be discussed. Major themes of medieval society such\nas pilgrimages, crusades, piety, the cult of relics, and the social and\nintellectual context of the Middle Ages are also part of this lecture.\nIn the ﬁrst weeks, important concepts of medieval society and its\narchitecture will be presented in combination with a number of\nnew technologies recently adopted in the ﬁeld.

We will give special focus to the fear of female inﬁdelity, the\ntheatrical fascination with the woman’s pregnant body, and the cultural\ndesire to conﬁrm and expose women’s chastity. We will read plays\nin which women are falsely accused of adultery, in various generic\ncontexts (such as William Shakespeare’s Cymbeline and Much Ado\nAbout Nothing), along with plays in which women actually commit\ninﬁdelity (such as the anonymous Arden of Faversham and Thomas\nMiddleton’s A Chaste Maid in Cheapside). Focusing on a different\nplay each week, we will ask: what does it take, ultimately, to believe\nwomen about their ﬁdelity? At the same time, what is the effect of\nbeing doubted on women themselves? We will also give consideration\nto the particular resources of dramatic form, paying attention to\nmoments in plays that coerce spectators themselves into mistaken\njudgments about women. We will supplement our reading of drama\nwith pamphlets, advice literature, poems, church court cases, and\nballads, in order to place these plays within a broader and more varied\nculture of female surveillance in early modern England.

In this course, we will try to tap\ninto this theater’s cosmopolitan, enlivened poetics by studying not only\nShakespeare, but also the various other major authors who constituted\nthis literary world: Christopher Marlowe, Ben Jonson, Thomas Dekker,\nThomas Middleton, John Webster, and the female playwright Aphra\nBehn.\nENGL BC3246 WRITING THE MEDIEVAL SELF. 3.00 points.\nThe late Middle Ages and early Renaissance saw an explosion\nin the use of the ﬁrst-person singular \"I\" by European writers of\nnarrative texts. Although these narratives – among them dream\nvisions, philosophical allegories, spiritual autobiographies, and\nstraight-up novels – do not always correspond to modern ideas about\nautobiography, they nonetheless demonstrate a growing interest in\nsuch \"autobiographical\" topics as personal identity, sexual difference,\nmental illness, and disability, even as they experiment with a variety of\nliterary forms and raise fundamental questions about the relationship\nbetween truth and writing. Writers will include Augustine, Dante,\nBoccaccio, Chaucer, Christine de Pisan, Thomas Hoccleve, Julian of\nNorwich and Teresa de Cartagena, among others.

While some of this poetry is\nreligious in nature, a great deal also addresses such diverse themes\nas desire, selfhood, politics, gender, and humanity’s relation to the non-\nhuman world. In this class we will examine medieval lyrics originally\ncomposed in a number of languages including but not limited to Old\nand Middle English, Latin, Occitan, Hebrew, Arabic, Italian, French,\nGerman and Portuguese.

However, this\ncourse will examine other “race” plays as well as works perceived as\n“race-neutral” in tandem with Black “respeakings” of Shakespeare’s\nworks. This class is antiracist in intent and is shaped by several\ninterlocking questions: What is Black Shakespeare? Can creators and\nscholars separate Shakespeare from the apparatus of white supremacy\nthat has been built around his works? What are the challenges for\nBIPOC actors performing Shakespeare on the dominant stage? What\nare the challenges and obstacles for BIPOC scholars working on\nShakespeare in academia?

Was it the ability of humans to talk, use tools, exercise\nrationality or something else? We will consider these questions in the\nﬁrst unit of this class, in which we’ll look at cases of what Agamben\ncalls “the anthropological machine”—the ways in which humans have\ndistinguished themselves from other species. Why do some bestiaries\n(catalogues of animals) include human animals but not others? How\ndid medieval people understand Genesis and the notion of ‘dominion’\ngiven to humans over the rest of creation? In the next unit, we will\nturn to talking animals, both in medieval philosophical texts and in\nliterature. Do they speak differently from human animals? Do humans\nspeak differently when speaking of them (for example, do texts about\nparrots or other bird mimics start to ‘parrot’ other texts?). We next\nturn to cases of metamorphosis (human to animal or vice versa) and\nhybridity (in which a single body is both human and animal). What do\nthese texts reveal about what is proper to the human and how does\nthe body play a role in shoring up species identity? In a ﬁnal unit, we\nturn to assemblages—conglomerations in which human and nonhuman\nanimals act together.

Often supposed to be a barbaric community of ignorant\nunruly men governed by greedy kings and popes, the medieval\nsociety in the popular culture is often an inspiration to the grotesque\nrepresentations of violence and torture. Even an intellectual like Michel\nFoucault did not hesitate to advance a theory of medieval punishment,\nalbeit a terribly wrong one, as one that focuses on the body and\nspectacle.  This course is designed to trace the origins of the modern\ncriminal legislation and practices to the Middle Ages, some of which\nwere jury trial, public persecution, and prisons. How did these practices\ncome about, and under which social conditions? The focus of the\ncourse will be on violent crimes, such as murder, robbery, assault and\nsuicide, and some particularly medieval crimes like sorcery, blasphemy\nand sodomy. The geographical scope will be limited to England, Italy\nand France. The class discussions are expected to take the form of\ncollective brainstorming on how the political powers, social classes,\ncultural values, and religious beliefs affect the development of criminal\nlegislation and institutions. Whenever possible the weekly readings will\nfeature a fair share of medieval texts, including trial records, criminal\nlaws, a manual for trying witches, and prison poetry.

Converts from\nJudaism and Islam to Christianity, not to mention a host of other\nminority Christian communities, often fell under inquisitorial suspicion.\nThe interrogation and censorship tactics employed by inquisitors and\ntheir agents to police these communities sometimes but not always\nentailed violence. Punishments for those convicted of infractions\nsimilarly ranged widely, from the notorious auto-de-fé to more minor\nacts of contrition. In this course, we will study these inquisitorial\nprocedures and their underlying theological presuppositions. We\nalso will examine how the “Holy Ofﬁce,” as it the inquisition was\nlikewise known, ﬁt into the broader religious and political cultures of\nthe Iberian world during the sixteenth century. That is, both Catholic\nand Protestant reformers of the period often emphasized inquisitorial\nviolence in order to smear their adversaries or make Spain seem\nbackward, while some apologists for Spanish empire and orthodoxy\ninsisted upon the noble intentions driving inquisition These early\nmodern tensions have shaped our late modern understanding of\ninquisition history. Over the course of the semester we will aim to\ntest these “black” and “white” legends of Spanish inquisitorial and\nimperial violence not only against a range of primary sources and\narchival documents from the sixteenth century, but also against\nour own presuppositions about tolerance and intolerance, religious\nfreedom, and the relationship between religion and secularism in\nthe present. Readings include inquisitorial case archives, polemical\nand pedagogical works by Nicolas Eimeric, Hernando de Talavera,\nTomás de Torquemada, and other early inquisitors and their critics,\nand articles and book chapters by modern scholars such as Christine\nCaldwell Ames, Wendy Brown, Michel Foucault, Carlo Ginzburg, Henry\nKamen, Doris Moreno, and others.\nMusic\nBarnard College Department of Music \n319 Milbank Hall \n212-854-5096 \nColumbia University Department of Music \n621 Dodge Hall \n212-854-3825  \nDepartment Administrative Assistant: Mary Missirian\nMission\nThe Barnard Music Program provides the vocal program for the\nuniversity, which includes the Barnard-Columbia Chorus and Chamber\nChoir, solo studio voice lessons and two levels of limited-enrollment\nvocal classes, Technique in Singing, and the Vocal Repertoire Class.\nIn addition, the program provides a music history course, Introduction\nto Music, which is a year-long survey of Western European art music,\nfrom sixth-century Gregorian Chant to the work of living composers.\nThe course fulﬁlls the Fine and Performing Arts requirement of the\nGeneral Education Requirements and also serves as a pre-requisite\nfor the music major.

This course will\nintroduce you to popular music studies, a ﬁeld of inquiry that draws\nscholars from a number of different disciplines, including musicology,\nsociology, philosophy, anthropology and literature. Examining rock\nmusic in an interdisciplinary way has opened the genre to increasing\nattention beyond musicological methodologies and assumptions. First,\nhowever, we must ask some fundamental questions: for instance, what,\nexactly, is popular music as well as, importantly, what differentiates\nrock music from other genres? Our deﬁnitions will reveal some of the\nassumptions we bring to any discussion of popular music. Throughout\nthis semester, we will question our assumptions about rock music\nculture through an investigation into a series of keywords. Each\nkeyword will focus our attention on various aspects of rock music in\norder to think through the complexities of what might, on the surface,\nseem self-evident.

With the arrival of the ﬁrst Jewish\nimmigrants in New York in the mid-1600s until today, Jewish music in\nthe City has oscillated between preserving traditions and introducing\ninnovative ideas. This course explores the variety of ways people\nhave used music to describe, inscribe, symbolize, and editorialize\ntheir Jewish experience. Along these lines, it draws upon genres of art\nmusic, popular music, and non-Western traditions, as well as practices\nthat synthesize various styles and genres, from hazzanut to hiphop.\nDiverse musical experiences will serve as a window to address wider\nquestions of identity, memory, and dislocation. We will also experience\nthe Jewish soundscape of New York’s dynamic and eclectic music\nculture by visiting various venues and meeting key players in today’s\nmusic scene, and thus engage in the ongoing dialogues that deﬁne\nJewishness in New York. A basic familiarity with Judaism and Jewish\nculture is helpful for this course, but it is by no means required.

This course examines the\nvarious ways in which these individuals have used music to perform\nand inscribe, symbolize, describe, and editorialize antisemitism. In so\ndoing, it focuses on musicking—a term that encompasses all musical\nactivity from composing to performing to listening—in the realms\nof art music, popular music, and non-Western traditions, as well as\nof genres that synthesize different styles. It also draws on sound,\nincluding language and speech as well as writings such as Wagner’s\nJudenthum in der Musik (1848−50/69) and Carl Engel’s The Music of\nthe Most Ancient Nations (1864). All of these will serve as a window\nthrough which to address the types of Jew-hatred that have become\nknown since the mid-nineteenth century as antisemitism—religious,\nnational and ethnic, political, populist, economic, and institutional\n—as well as hate speech or “hate talk” and the Jewish responses to\nit. A basic familiarity with music is helpful for this course, but it is\nnot required as long as there is an openness to listening to music\nand a commitment to basic aural analysis. You do not need to know\nJewish history to take this class, nor do you need to be able to read\nmusic. Translations will be provided, and musical analysis will be well\nexplained.

Music is our point of departure, and students\nwill learn ways in which sonic practices shaped and challenged\nlegislative paradigms. Our focus is on American musics such as Native\nAmerican music, blues, country, jazz, rhythm and blues, rock and roll,\nexperimental music, hip hop, pop, as well as some European classical\nmusic, “world” music, and EDM. Students will read and analyze legal\nprimary sources such as the Music Modernization Act, as well as\nlandmark court cases, critical legal literature, and musicological texts.\nStudents will learn debate skills, acquire practical knowledge of the law\nthrough concepts such as fair use, the public domain and mechanical\nand performance rights, and develop listening skills to understand\nlegal concepts such as infringement. This course is open to students\nof all majors and will be of particular interest to musicians, students\nwith plans to pursue a law degree in IP or technology law, as well\nas those interested in working in the music industry. There are no\nprerequisites and no previous knowledge of music, music theory, or\nthe law is necessary.

As a result, speciﬁc music\ngenres and practitioners are linked to particular fashion trends and\nmovements that represent their persona and appearance. In various\ncultures around the world, music and fashion play a signiﬁcant role\nin marking identity, as practitioners’ cultural heritage impacts the\nchoice of costumes they wear during performances in different spaces\nand times.

This\nclass explores Some of the questions: How does fashion become\na visual representation of speciﬁc music cultures, subcultures,\ngenres, movements, and artists? How does fashion reflect, influence,\ninspire, evolve, spread, sustain, represent, affect, and communicate\nmusical ideas? To answer these questions, musical fashion icons\nsuch as Beyoncé, Prince, Rihanna, Lady Gaga, and David Bowie,\nand genres like Hip Hop, rock, Opera, K-pop, Afrobeats, and other\nglobal genres are examined through written scholarships, analysis\nof music performances and costumes, and their appearances in\nevents and everyday life.

The world of\nmusic, and the music industry itself, is changing rapidly, and with that\nchange comes the opening – and closing – of doorways of possibility.\nWhat does this shift mean for today’s practicing artist or composer?\nWith big label recording studios signing and nurturing fewer and fewer\nartists, it seems certain that, today, musicians who want to record and\ndistribute their music need to be able to do much of the recording and\nproduction work on their own. But where does one go to learn how\nto do this – to learn not only the “how to” part of music production,\nbut the historical underpinnings and the development of the music\nproduction industry as well? How does one develop a comprehensive\nframework within which they can place their own artistic efforts? How\ndoes one learn to understand what they hear, re-create what they like\nand develop their own style? This class, “Recorded Sound,” aims to be\nthe answer. It’s goal is to teach artists how to listen critically to music\nfrom across history and genres in order to identify the production\ntechniques that they hear, and reproduce those elements using modern\ntechnology so they can be incorporated into the artist’s own musical\nworks.\nFall 2024: MUSI GU4630\nCourse\nNumber\nSection/Call\nNumber\nTimes/Location Instructor Points Enrollment\nMUSI 4630 001/10190 M 1:10pm - 4:00pm \n317 Prentis Hall\nDavid\nAdamcyk\n3.00 11/15\nMUSI 4630 002/17470 W 1:10pm - 4:00pm \n317 Prentis Hall\nDanielle\nDobkin\n3.00 8/15\nSpring 2025: MUSI GU4630\nCourse\nNumber\nSection/Call\nNumber\nTimes/Location Instructor Points Enrollment\nMUSI 4630 001/11781 T 10:10am - 1:00pm \n317 Prentis Hall\nAnna Meadors 3.00 12/12\nMUSI GU4802 Sound, Music and Death. 3 points.\nThis seminar is an exploration of the roles of sound and music play in\npeople’s attempts to grapple with death and its many auras. We will\nread literature from ethnomusicology, anthropology, and sound studies,\nand listen to musics from many parts of the world, so as to investigate\nhow 1) the processes of aging, decay, and mourning; 2) metaphorical\ndeaths including war and exile; and 3) imaginations of afterlives\nresound among the living.\nMUSI GU4810 Sound: Foundations. 3.00 points.\nThis foundational course in sound will begin by exploring how listening\nhappens as well the tools necessary capture and present that listening.\nThrough hands-on experimentation and demonstration, this seminar\nwill examine both the technical and semiotic use of sound as amaterial\nwithin creative practice. Fundamental studio techniques will be\nexplored including soldering for building cables, microphones, and\nloudspeakers. We will also explore the building blocks of analog and\ndigital processes for the creation of sound, including microphones\n(types, patterns, and placement), basic synthesis, and techniques for\nrecording, mixing, editing, and mastering. Through creative projects\nthat implement these skills we will learn by doing. We will study\ntheories of sound and listening that determine or are determined by\ntechnology, from the physical and social dimensions of the sounds\nwe use to create, language (sound as a symbol or object), acoustics\n(sound in space), acousmatics (sound without a visual reference), and\npsycho-acoustics (sound as cognitive process). This class assumes\nno prior knowledge or technical skill.

The philosophy major introduces students to\ncentral concepts, key ﬁgures, and classic and contemporary texts so\nthey may broaden and deepen their own understanding as they learn\nhow others have approached foundational questions in the past. An\neducation in philosophy also teaches students to think and write with\nclarity and precision – intellectual resources essential to future study\nand rewarding professional lives.\nStudent Learning Outcomes\nStudents graduating with a B.A. in philosophy will have acquired skills\nin critical thinking, conceptual analysis, argumentation, close reading\nof classic and contemporary philosophical texts, and composition of\nclear, cogent, and persuasive prose. More speciﬁcally, they will be able\nto:\n1. Demonstrate their knowledge of major thinkers (such as Plato,\nAristotle, Descartes, Hume, Kant) and texts of the ancient and\nmodern philosophical traditions;\n2. Demonstrate their understanding of central problems and\ndominant theoretical traditions in moral theory (Kantianism,\nutilitarianism) and either epistemology (skepticism, other minds,\nthe problem of induction, decision theory), metaphysics (the mind-\nbody problem, free will and determinism, causation, the nature of\nspace and time), or the philosophy of language;\n3.

But there is surprisingly little\nconsensus across Buddhist traditions about what does exist and what\nit’s like. In this course, we will examine several Buddhist theories about\nthe nature and structure of reality and consider the epistemological\nand ethical implications of these radically different pictures of the\nworld. We will analyze and evaluate arguments from some of the\nmost influential Indian Buddhist philosophers from the second to\nthe eleventh centuries, including Nāgārjuna, Vasubandhu, Dignāga,\nCandrakīrti, Śāntarak#ita, Śāntideva, and Ratnakīrti.

What are\nthe relations between our goals and the means to them? How can we\nbetter understand our goals to make the means more suitable? When\nwe organize to produce results, what are we doing? Do we know exactly\nwho and what we want to change? What are the “ethics of process”?\nWhat exactly do we do when we organize? A tentative deﬁnition: to\norganize is to bring together individuals who have common interests in\na way that will enhance their power. What kind of power is this? What\nother forms of power are there? What is the best form of coordinating\namong individuals? If we better understand the dynamics of organizing,\nshould we reconceive our goals accordingly? How do we better tap\ninto shared values and concerns? What temptations and distractions\nget in the way of our goals? What problems prevent us from achieving\nthem?

We love\nthem, befriend them and save them. We hunt, farm and eat them.\nWe experiment on and observe them to discover more about them\nand to discover more about ourselves. For many of us, our pets are\namongst the most familiar inhabitants of our world. Yet when we try\nto imagine what is going on in a dog or cat's mind--let alone that of\na crow, octopus or bee--many of us are either stumped about how\nto go about this, or (the science strongly suggests) getting things\nradically wrong. Is our thought about and behavior towards animals\nethically permissible, or even consistent, Can we reshape our habits of\nthought about animals to allow for a more rational, richer relationship\nwith the other inhabitants of our planet? In this course, students will\nreflect on two closely intertwined questions: an ethical question,\nwhat sort of relationship ought we to have with animals?; and a\nmetaphysical question, what is the nature of animal minds? Readings\nwill primarily be be from philosophy and ethics and the cognitive\nsciences, with additional readings from literature and biology.  There\nare no prerequisites for this class--it will be helpful but certainly not\nnecessary to have taken previous classes in philosophy(especially\nethics and philosophy of mind) or in cognitive science.\nPHIL UN3841 Advanced Introduction to Aesthetics: Philosophy of the\nImage. 3 points.\nThis course is an advanced introduction to philosophical aesthetics focused primarily on the question: how do artistic images achieve their distinctive effect? A traditional (Platonic) answer to that question is that images do so by resembling their objects in a distinctive way. However, criticisms of this view, from various directions, will motivate us to consider some less familiar alternatives. We will begin with a proposal from 20th century \"analytical\" philosophy: on this view, images \"symbolize\" in the way mathematical equations, linguistic signs and non artistic images like maps and diagrams do. Next, we will consider a proposal from the \"phenomenological\" tradition: rather than merely affording us visual experiences, images provide a holistic embodied experience in which we are solicited to move and act. Finally, we will consider a distinctive proposal from social theory, and, in particular, the Marxist tradition: on this view, images in late capitalist societies serve a distinctive secularizing function y emancipating the artwork from its ritual function and removing its sacred aura. The course is bookended by units on artistic images in general, but contains units on artistic images of all kinds (photographs, ﬁlms, and paintings). Readings are numerous, short, and drawn from a wide variety of types of sources (interviews, academic articles, manifestos, book\nlength works), thinkers, and traditions. Students will leave having read at least one modern classic in the ﬁeld: Goodman's _Languages of Art_. They will also watch part of one (highly philosophical) ﬁlm: Malick's _Badlands_. The course has no prerequisites.\nPHIL UN3851 IF I WERE YOU: IDENTITY, ESSENCE, LIMITS OF MODAL\nVARIATION. 3.00 points.\nThis course will be devoted to the topic of being other than oneself\nand the metaphysical debate surrounding questions like: What does\nthe possibility of being different from who we are amount to? What\ndoes it mean to be someone else? How different from ourselves can\nwe be? Students will be offered analytical and philosophical tools that\nwill help them to rigorously formulate those and related questions,\nand to think through the nature of modal variation and its boundaries.\nIn the ﬁnal weeks of the semester, we will explore the application of\nthose theoretical tools to relevant themes in metaphysics of gender.\nThroughout the seminar, students will be encouraged to think of\nthe implications of our discussion for related debates in philosophy,\nespecially in the epistemology of the modal and counterfactual claims\nat issue.

We move chronologically,\nstarting with Zeno and Aristotle, through the invention of calculi of\ninﬁnitesimals, to the development of set theory, model theory, and\nmodern mathematical logic. We will also use the tools we develop\nin our historical investigation to address modern discussions in\nphilosophy about the inﬁnite, such as the debates about supertasks\nand the limitations of computation. This course has no prerequisites\n(although having taken Symbolic Logic may be useful), and it serves\nwell as an introduction to philosophy of mathematics because of its\nchronological presentation. It also intersects with a wide range of\ntopics in other ﬁelds, such as mathematics, logic, physics, computer\nscience, religion, and artiﬁcial intelligence, which should make it of\ninterest even to those who may not have a strong formal background.\nPHIL UN3856 Political Realism and Social Injustice. 3 points.\nRectifying injustice remains a central motivation for social and political\nthought. The aim of a theory of justice or injustice is often to guide us\nin dealing with the grave wrongs in our social world. But how should\nphilosophy support the advancement of justice, and what do its moral\nideals have to do with the political realities of power and conflict? Do\nwe need an “ideal theory” of a perfectly just society to set the aims\nof social progress? Can we properly respond to racial and gendered\ninjustices without understanding how they wrong people as members\nof social groups (e.g. as black Americans, women, etc.)? What limits\ndo our theories face in helping us navigate real political decisions\nand problems? This course will examine different answers to these\nquestions as well as their substantive consequences for addressing\npressing injustices based on race and gender. Our investigations will\nemphasize the relations between political philosophy, social science,\nthe social construction of identity, and real-world politics.", "source": "pdfs/barnard 2024-2025.pdf"}

Are both equally valuable? What\nis the relationship between public opinion and a healthy democracy?\nHow does capitalism and the mass medial affect the public sphere?\nWhat are the dangers of an impoverished public sphere?

But what exactly does this mean? What is genuine\nindividuality, and how can we develop it, in ourselves (though self-\ndevelopment) and in others (by designing appropriate educational\ninstitutions)? What is the relationship between being an individual and\nbeing a part of society? Is there a tension between the non-conformism\noften associated with genuine individuality on the one hand, and\nthe demands of community and good citizenship, on the other? Can\neducational institutions be designed to fulﬁll both those demands\n(to the extent they are distinct)? And how might oppressive social\ninstitutions hinder the development of “individuality”? In this course,\nwe will explore these and related questions by drawing on both the\nclassics of philosophy of education (Plato, Rousseau, Nietzsche,\nDewey, Du Bois), and on relevant literary material that is in conversation\nwith the philosophical texts (Rilke, Tolstoy, Woolf)\nPHIL UN3861 Language # Society. 3.00 points.\nLanguage is our primary means for influencing each other’s thoughts\nand attitudes. Sometimes, we use it to convey information explicitly,\nand to influence others directly. But sometimes, language is used to\nconvey information implicitly (e.g., in hints, sarcasm and irony), or to\nshape the opinions of others surreptitiously (e.g., in propaganda). How\ndo these forms of communication work? What distinguishes them?\nWhat makes for their success or failure? In this course, we will critically\nexamine some classic theories in the philosophy of language that try to\nanswer these questions. Then, we will turn to recent work that rejects\nor extends these theories in response to careful examination of the\nways in which language can be exploited as a means for manipulation\nand control\nPHIL UN3863 HAPPINESS AND WELL-BEING. 3.00 points.\n“What is it to be happy?” Philosophers have passionately debated this\nquestion from antiquity until now. Especially in times when happiness\nseems difﬁcult to ﬁnd, we naturally want to know what happiness is\nand how best to secure it. In this course, we will consider happiness\nin relation to well-being, examining four major theories of well-being\n(hedonism, desire-fulﬁllment theories, objective list theories, and\neudaimonism/perfectionism). We will gain a nuanced understanding\nof each view by juxtaposing their ancient and modern advocates and\nopponents\nPHIL UN3864 Philosophy, Science, and Politics of Learning. 3 points.\nNot offered during 2023-2024 academic year.\nAt the broadest level, this course addresses questions, What does it\nmean to respond to new information in a rational way? How should we\nupdate our beliefs in response to evidence? This is a central question\nin the philosophy of science and epistemology, but it also connects\nto important issues in social and political philosophy.  For example,\none's views about what it means to learn in a rational way might\ninform one's view about the signiﬁcance of political polarization.  Is\npolarization a sign that certain groups are responding to information\nin an irrational way? In order to address questions like this, one must\nﬁrst think carefully about what rational responses to inform amount\nto.  This is what we'll do in this course.  The course has three parts.  In\nthe ﬁrst part, we will read some classical philosophical texts about the\nproblem of induction.  This part of the course will introduce students to\nsome influential concepts from logic (formal learning theory), statistics\n(Bayesian inference), and computer science and artiﬁcial intelligence\n(PAC learning).  Having developed a toolkit for thinking about rational\nlearning, we will, in the third part of the course, turn to some issues in\nsocial and political philosophy.  In addition to thinking about political\npolarization, mentioned above, we will ask whether learning based\non the testimony of others has any distinctive signiﬁcance, and we\nwill study the concept of epistemic injustice.  The course has no\nprerequisites.  All of the technical concepts will be introduced in a self-\ncontained and elemental way.", "source": "pdfs/barnard 2024-2025.pdf"}
{"page_index": 498, "page_content": "498  Philosophy\nPHIL UN3867 Philosophy & Literature: Jane Austen & Moral\nPhilosophy. 3 points.\nIn the 1790s, when Jane Austen was beginning to write ﬁction, there\nwas much debate over the value and function of the novel. Some\nargued that novels were dangerous to their readers, inciting violent\nemotional responses and corrupting the imagination (especially in\nwomen and children, who were believed to be more sensitive to such\nstimuli). Others saw potential in this narrative form, arguing that\nnovels could contribute to the moral and sentimental education of\ntheir readers. Adam Smith, for example, claims that “[t]he poets and\nromance writers, who best paint the reﬁnements and delicacies of love\nand friendship, and of all other private and domestic affections, Racine\nand Voltaire; Richardson, Maurivaux, and Riccoboni; are, in such cases,\nmuch better instructors than Zeno, Chrysippus, or Epictetus” (Theory\nof Moral Sentiments III.3.14). And David Hume argues that there is\na kind of moral philosophy that paints virtue and vice rather than\nanatomizing it. Such philosopher-painters, he says, “make us feel\nthe difference between vice and virtue; they excite and regulate our\nsentiments” (Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding 1.1). \nIn this course, we will keep these questions about one possible\nfunction of literature in the back of our minds as we read through four\nof Austen’s novels. With each novel, we will focus on a speciﬁc ethical\ntheme treated in and by that novel: with Sense and Sensibility we’ll focus\non the role of the emotions in morality; with Mansﬁeld Park we’ll focus\non questions about moral education and virtue; with Emma we’ll focus\non the difﬁculties of accurate discernment and judgment in moral\nmatters; and with Persuasion we’ll focus on the relation between the\nindividual and society and the complications caused by differences\nin gender, class, and social status. Each novel will be paired with\nselections from authors who were near contemporaries of Austen’s,\nincluding Samuel Johnson, David Hume, Jane Collier, Hannah More,\nAdam Smith, and Mary Wollstonecraft. \nTwo warnings/things to be aware of: ﬁrst, this course will require a\nsigniﬁcant amount of reading; and second, in this course, we will be\napproaching literature with an interest in philosophical themes and\nquestions.

It is open to undergraduate and graduate students and\ndoes not presuppose prior study of Plato. At the end of the semester,\nstudents will have the tools and preparation to think independently\nand critically about Plato’s philosophy. Beyond the study of Plato, the\ncourse teaches students crucial skills in the history of philosophy,\nsuch as the careful reconstruction of arguments, attention to concepts\nthat may not be familiar today, critical discussion of philosophical\nproposals that were formulated in a foreign language and conceptual\nscheme, and an awareness of the range of different modes of inquiry\nand philosophical writing. The class covers three texts that, according\nto standard relative chronology of Plato’s dialogues, are considered\n“early”—the Protagoras—“middle”—the Phaedo—and “late”—the\nSophist. We focus on themes where Plato’s arguments and proposals\nhave lasting influence: virtue, the soul, perception, pleasure and pain,\nthe Forms, being and becoming, and truth and falsity. The Protagoras\nintroduces themes that we pursue throughout the semester. What\nis the soul? How does one become a good person? What is the role\nof pleasure and pain in a well-lived human life? In the Protagoras,\nSocrates advances a famous proposal, the so-called unity of the\nvirtues: for someone to have one virtue such as justice or courage,\nshe needs to have all the virtues. The question of how one becomes a\ngood person involves a key distinction in Plato’s metaphysics between\nbeing and becoming. Presumably, we can only become good, but we\ncan never be good. The Phaedo examines four arguments for the soul’s\nimmortality. None of these arguments is presented as conclusive. And\nyet, Socrates trusts that the soul is immortal and this commitment\ninforms his stance toward his own death. This theme is personal for\nSocrates, who is awaiting his death penalty. But it involves perennial\nquestions in metaphysics and the philosophy of mind. What is the\nrelation between body and soul? Are perception, pleasure, and pain\nbodily? Is our own mind the cause of our actions? What, if anything,\nis the role of mind—nous—in the cosmos? And what is the role of the\nfamous “Forms”? Plato’s Sophist belongs to a group of late dialogues\nthat explore, ﬁne-tune, and problematize Plato’s earlier proposals,\nspeciﬁcally with respect to the Forms, the notions of being and not-\nbeing, and the distinction between true and false statements. The\ninterlocutors set out to deﬁne sophistry, using a deﬁnitional method\nthat Plato develops in several late dialogues. This method is the\nancestor of a powerful but contested scientiﬁc tool: the division of\nthings into kinds. Finally, we use the Sophist to ask general questions\nabout Plato’s dialogues. Why does Plato write dialogues, rather than\ntreatises? What is philosophically distinctive about his method?\nPHIL GU4089 Aristotle. 3 points.\nNot offered during 2023-2024 academic year.\nThe course offers a high-level survey of central themes in Aristotle's\nethics: happiness, motivation, agency, excellence, deliberation,\npleasure, responses to relativism, and the nature of ethics.\nPHIL GU4100 Paradoxes. 3 points.\nVarious paradoxes, from many areas, including mathematics, physics,\nepistemology, decision theory and ethics, will be analyzed.

Apart from subsequent developments within the\nmind sciences, another major difference between James's pioneering\nwork and current scientiﬁc work is that it is explicitly governed by some\nconcerns that currently belong more to philosophy than to science.\nThese include James's focus on the phenomenological dimensions\nof mind that are open to direct introspection, which are no longer\nregarded as reliable indicators of mental reality, and his interest in the\nethical signiﬁcance of his ﬁndings.

All majors engage in at least one\nsummer of independent research that is often continued during the\nsemester, or the following summer. Students may also carry out their\nresearch at other institutions nationally, through NSF-REU (Research\nExperience for Undergraduates) programs. Students are required to\npresent the results of their research in the annual departmental “Senior\nTalks,” held in May.\nStudent Learning Goals\n• Acquire a strong intellectual foundation in physics and/or\nastronomy.\n• Apply scientiﬁc thinking to problems in physics and/or astronomy,\nand translate this to real life problems.\n• Use mathematics to describe and manipulate abstract concepts in\nphysics and/or astronomy.\n• Perform laboratory experiments to study various physical\nphenomena, and use statistical approaches to analyze and\ninterpret the data obtained in these experiments.\n• Acquire effective oral and written presentation skills to\ncommunicate scientiﬁc ideas.\n• Participate in a research project and stimulate the ability of\nempirical thought.\n• Demonstrate the ability to give a scientiﬁc talk on a research topic.\nStudent Learning Outcomes\nUpon successfully completing the major, students should have the\nability to:\n• demonstrate a conceptual understanding of the physical laws of\nnature.\n• demonstrate a thorough knowledge of the various subject\nareas of physics (e.g. classical mechanics, quantum physics,\nelectromagnetism,  and thermodynamics) and/or astronomy\n(e.g. stellar structure and evolution, physics of the solar system,\nphysical cosmology, and observational astronomy).\n• apply problem-solving skills beyond graduation in advanced\nphysics and/or astronomy courses in graduate school and\nindependent research projects.", "source": "pdfs/barnard 2024-2025.pdf"}

Physicists were, in essence, natural philosophers,\nseeking knowledge of the observable phenomenal world. Astronomy\noriginally concentrated on the study of natural phenomena in the\nheavens with the intent to understand the constitution, relative\npositions, and motions of the celestial bodies in our universe. Though\npractitioners of these disciplines have become somewhat more\nspecialized in the past century, the spirit that guides them in their\nresearch remains the same as it was more than two millennia ago.\nIn cooperation with the faculty of the University, Barnard offers a\nthorough pre-professional curriculum in both physics and astronomy.\nThe faculty represents a wide range of expertise, with special strength\nand distinction in theoretical physics, condensed matter physics, and\nobservational astrophysics.\nSeparate majors in physics and astronomy are offered. A major in\nastrophysics is also possible. Furthermore, there are many special\ninterdisciplinary majors possible, such as biophysics, chemical physics,\nengineering physics, and mathematical physics. There is a physics\nminor as well. Students should consult members of the department\nearly on in their undergraduate careers in order to plan the most\neffective course of study. Qualiﬁed seniors are invited to participate\nin the seniors honors program, in which they carry out a year-long\nresearch project leading to the thesis.\nThere are several quite distinct introductory sequences in physics, only\none of which may be taken for credit:\n1. PHYS UN1001 PHYSICS FOR POETS - is a lecture course in physics\nintended for liberal arts students. A semester of this CU lecture\ncourse satisﬁes the BC Quantitative Reasoning requirement. Note,\nhowever, that 1001 does not satisfy the premedical nor physics\nrequirement for any major. It also should not be taken to satisfy the\nBC lab science requirement.\n2. PHYS BC2001 MECHANICS - LECTURE LAB - PHYS BC2002\nELECTRICITY#MAGNETISM-LEC LAB, PHYS BC3001 CLASSICAL\nWAVES - LECTURE LAB is Barnard's own three-semester, calculus\nbased introductory sequence in physics. Characterized by modest\nclass sizes, it is designed speciﬁcally for Barnard students with\na serious interest in any of the natural sciences or mathematics.\nMoreover, it is especially appropriate for majors in physics,\nastronomy, chemistry, or biochemistry, whether premedical or\nnot. Biology majors with some calculus background are also\nencouraged to take this sequence. Finally, Barnard students\ncontemplating a major in physics or astronomy should take\nPHYS BC2001 MECHANICS - LECTURE LAB - PHYS BC2002\nELECTRICITY#MAGNETISM-LEC LAB in their ﬁrst year, if possible,\nor in their second at the latest, to be followed by the third-semester\ncourse, Classical Waves.\n3. First-year students with exceptional aptitude for physics (as\nevidenced, for example, by scores of 4 or 5 on the advanced\nplacement C exam) and a good mathematical background may\nbe admitted into the Columbia-taught two-semester sequence\nPHYS UN2801 ACCELERATED PHYSICS I - PHYS UN2802\nACCELERATED PHYSICS II, which replaces all three terms of the\nsequence for majors. Students considering this sequence are\nstrongly encouraged to consult a Barnard faculty member at the\nstart of the term.\nFor more information on majors and minors see the \"Requirements\"\ntab.\nStudents unsure about the most appropriate sequence should consult\nthe Chair of the department.\nChair: Timothy Halpin-Healy\nProfessors: Timothy Halpin-Healy, Laura Kay, Janna Levin (Claire\nTow Professor of Physics & Astronomy), Reshmi Mukherjee (Helen\nGoodhart Altschul Professor of Physics and Astronomy)\nSenior Lecturer and Lab Director: Dr. Stiliana Savin\nLaboratory Instructional Support Specialist: Dr. Sara Abedi\nAdvanced courses are offered in collaboration with the Columbia\nPhysics and Astronomy Departments.\nRequirements for the Astronomy Major\nThe courses required for the major in astronomy are as follows:\nPHYS BC2001 MECHANICS - LECTURE LAB * 4.5\nPHYS BC2002 ELECTRICITY#MAGNETISM-LEC LAB * 4.5\nPHYS BC3001 CLASSICAL WAVES - LECTURE LAB * 5\nASTR UN2001 \n& ASTR UN2002\nINTRO TO ASTROPHYSICS I \nand INTRO TO ASTROPHYSICS II\n6\nStudents are required to take four 3000-level ASTR or PHYS courses,\nand selected so that at least six total points of 3000-level lecture\nclasses are ASTR courses.

{"page_index": 514, "page_content": "514  Political Science\nThe two colloquia must be taken with faculty at Barnard College. Many\nof the lecture courses may be taken with faculty at Columbia College,\nif these courses are cross-listed. Various study-abroad options and\nsummer courses also may meet your specialized interests, but these\nrequire\n1. prior consultation with your major adviser, as well as\n2. prior approval by the Associate Departmental Chair and\n3. subsequent approval by the Associate Department Chair once you\napply to transfer the credit to Barnard (use the Course Approval\nRequest Form for steps 2 and 3).\nStudents interested in the Sciences Po–Barnard ﬁve-year joint-degree\nprogram are encouraged to meet with the Dean for Study-Abroad, also\nregarding the political science aspects of this BA/MA program. The\nrequirements are at the end of this page.\nIntroductory-level Lecture Course Requirement (three\nlecture courses)\nThe political science department requires all students to take at least\none introductory 1000- or 3000-level lecture course in three of the\nfour subﬁelds of political science (listed above).  These courses are\ndesigned to provide an introduction to the main subject matter and\nmajor theories of each subﬁeld.\nThese courses also serve to familiarize students with the analytic\napproaches that political scientists use. After taking lecture courses\nin the relevant subﬁelds, students are eligible to take the two required\ncolloquium courses.\nAdvanced Placement Credit\nA student granted Advanced Placement (AP) credit by the College in\neither American Politics or Comparative Politics with an exam score\nof 5 will have fulﬁlled the prerequisite for courses that require the\nprior completion of POLS UN1201 INTRO TO AMERICAN POLITICS\nor POLS UN1501 INTRO TO COMPARATIVE POLITICS, respectively.\nIf the student wants to take the introductory American Politics or\nComparative Politics course, she may do so, but she will forfeit her\ncorresponding AP credit.\nAP credit does not count toward the number of courses required for the\nmajor or minor, i.e. the student still needs to complete the ten courses\nfor the major or the ﬁve for the minor.\nElectives Requirement (ﬁve additional courses)\nAll political science courses emphasize social scientiﬁc reasoning\nand theory application. In addition, political science majors chose\nﬁve electives (normally at the 3000- or 4000-level). These courses\nare designed to deepen and expand students’ knowledge base and\nencourage them to apply social scientiﬁc reasoning and theories to the\nanalysis of a broad range of political issues and problems.\nWhat fulﬁlls the Five-Course Electives requirement\n1. All courses offered at Barnard or Columbia in political\nscience listed in the Barnard Course Catalogue, including\nintroductory lecture courses and colloquia, satisfy elective course\nrequirements. \n2. The Independent Study Option POLS BC3799 INDEPENDENT\nSTUDY. Students who wish to do an independent study project\n(ISP) should ﬁrst speak to a political science faculty member\nwilling to sponsor it. Credit is given for an academic research paper\nwritten in conjunction with an internship, but no academic credit\nis given for an internship or job experience. The student must then\napply to the Committee on Programs and Academic Standing\n(CPAS), which must approve all Independent Study requests. Once\nthe request is granted, the Registrar creates a section and assigns\na call number, and the student is notiﬁed of the call number so\nshe can enter the course on her program. (Each instructor has\na separate section and call number. Each instructor is limited to\nsponsoring one independent study per semester.) Students will\nconsult with the sponsoring instructor as to workload and points\nof credit for the independent study course.  Independent study\ncounts as a course for the purpose of the nine-course requirement,\nprovided the project is approved for 3 or 4 points. A project taken\nfor 1 or 2 points does not count as a course toward the major, the\nminor, or the concentration requirement.\n3. With pre-approval, ﬁrst from the individual Major Advisor and then\nfrom the Associate Department Chair, a student may substitute a\ncourse in another department for one of the four elective courses.\nThis course cannot be an introductory course and it must have\nsigniﬁcant political science content (use the Course Approval\nRequest Form). Approval after the fact will not be granted.\n4. Six of the courses for the major must be taken from courses listed\nin the political science section of the Barnard Course Catalogue.\nWithin the three-course limit of courses taken elsewhere, the\nfollowing caps traditionally apply: three transfer courses; two Reid\nHall courses; two study-abroad courses; one summer session\ncourse. On rare occasions the Associate Department Chair may\ngrant an exception (use the Course Approval Request Form).\nWhat does not fulﬁll the Five-Course Electives requirements\nThe Independent Study Option POLS BC3799 INDEPENDENT STUDY\ndoes not satisfy the course requirement if the project is for 1 or 2\npoints.\nCollege-granted AP credit for American Politics or Comparative Politics\ndoes not count as major course credit. (See Advanced Placement\nCredit, above.)\nCourses taken at other colleges, in summer sessions, or abroad,\nwhich are not equivalent in rigor and workload to Barnard courses, as\ndetermined by the Associate Department Chair, in consultation with\nother faculty of the department, will not count toward the major or\nminor requirements.\nColloquium Requirement ( two one-semester courses)\nAlthough all political science courses teach students to generate\nand test hypotheses about political processes, relationships and\ninstitutions and/or engage in conceptual analysis and interpretation of\npolitical ideas, arguments and phenomena, students are encouraged\nto do this at a higher level in their two required colloquia. These\ncolloquia feature intensive, small group discussions and a major\nresearch project, and provide students with an opportunity to work\nmore independently than they probably have in previous courses.\nThe colloquium format involves weekly discussion of readings, and\ndevelopment of research skills through completion of a major research\nproject. Admission is limited to sixteen students. Students must have\ncompleted any required pre-requisite courses.

In this course, we will examine why parties\nformed despite the Founders’ disdain for them. (In 1789, Thomas\nJefferson wrote, “If I could not go to heaven but with a party, I would\nnot go at all.” In 1800, he won the presidency as a candidate of a major\nparty.) We will dig into scholarly debates about what exactly parties\nare, what purpose they serve, and how and why they have changed over\ntime as organizations, in the electorate, and in government.\nTopics will include the presidential nomination process from the\nfounding through the much-discussed 2016 primary election season,\nthe life cycle of third parties, and the relationship between political\nparties and interest groups. Students will learn what is and is not\nunique about the current historical moment, and how history might\nshape our expectations of parties moving forward.\nThroughout the course, we will pay particularly close attention to the\nroots of contemporary party polarization, and the implications of this\nphenomenon for representation and governance. In 1950, the American\nPolitical Science Association released a report criticizing the two\nmajor parties for excessive similarity; today, party polarization evokes\nwidespread concern. Is there an ideal level of party difference? How\nmuch is too much? We will address these difﬁcult questions, among\nothers, in this broad survey of American political parties.\nFall 2024: POLS BC3025\nCourse\nNumber\nSection/Call\nNumber\nTimes/Location Instructor Points Enrollment\nPOLS 3025 001/00456 M W 10:10am - 11:25am \n140 Horace Mann Hall\nKatherine\nKrimmel\n3 24/40\nPOLS BC3031 THE AMERICAN PRESIDENCY. 3.00 points.\nThis course explores the role of the presidency in U.S. politics.\nPresidents have long been at the center of politics, yet the nature of\nthe presidency has changed dramatically over time. The ﬁrst part of\nthe course will examine these long-run changes. It begins with debates\nover the form of the presidency at the U.S.’s founding and examines\nhow the institution has been altered – and with what effects – at key\nhistorical moments. Having gained foundational historical knowledge\nduring the ﬁrst part of the course, the course’s second part will focus\non various theories of the presidency. These theories primarily address,\nin various ways, one primary question: which factors best explain\npresidential “success”? By the end of the course, students should be\nable to systematically assess contemporary presidential politics using\nvarious scholarly theories and by putting the president’s actions into\na broader historical context.

These links\nalso reach back in history to global wars of empire and colonial rule,\nrace relations during and following the collapse of the institution of\nslavery, and contemporary drug wars being waged across the Western\nHemisphere and other parts of the world. Today, the dynamics and\nconsequences of the politics of illicit drugs touch all our lives in\ndifferent ways, including individual and family struggles with substance\nabuse, everyday encounters with militarized police, and the strains\non democracy and citizenship, among many others. This course will\nexamine some of these dynamics and consequences with a theoretical\nand empirical focus mainly on Latin America and the United States.\nThroughout our time together we will connect these pressing issues\nto broader theories, concepts and empirical ﬁndings in political\nscience. The course is divided into several individual modules (denoted\nbelow with the headings A – G) under three overarching themes for\nthis semester: 1. Politics of Drugs in a Historical Perspective: The\nﬁrst theme is a broad historical overview of the political origins of\nillicit drugs and the global drug regime. Some of the main questions\nwe will tackle are: When and why did states label drugs as illicit?\nHow did domestic and global politics come together to shape the\nglobal drug regime and the “war on drugs?” What role did race and\ngender play in the early social construction of illicit drugs? 2. Illicit\nDrugs, Politics and Governance: The second theme focuses on\ncontemporary linkages between illicit drugs, violence, and politics.\nHere we will examine the conditions under which illicit drug markets\nare either violent or (relatively) peaceful. We will tackle questions\nlike: Do states always seek to dismantle drug markets? What is the\nrelationship between illicit drugs and electoral politics? What role\ndo illicit drugs play in governance by armed non-state actors? Are\nstates and criminal actors involved in the drug trade always at “war”\nwith each other? 3. Democracy, Citizenship, and the War on Drugs:\nThe third and ﬁnal theme centers on the political consequences\nof the war on drugs for questions of democracy and citizenship in\nthe Western Hemisphere. Some of the questions that will help us\nmake sense of these consequences are: How does the war on drugs\nimpact democracy and citizenship? What is the political economy of\nimprisonment? And in what ways do imprisonment and police-citizen\ninteractions – stemming from the war on drugs – shape individual and\ncollective political behavior and political subjectivity?\nPOLS UN3604 War, Peace, and International Interventions in Africa. 4\npoints.\nThis course analyzes the causes of violence in wars and examines the\ndebates around emergency aid, peacekeeping and peacebuilding.

These trends may\nhave dire consequences for the state of representative democracy in\nthe United States, as they endow a relatively small number of citizens\nwith a disproportionate amount of resources to deploy politically. The\nresult is a political system that often responds to the preferences of\nthe wealthiest Americans, while frequently ignoring the views of most\nordinary citizens. This course, in diverse ways, explores the political\ncauses and consequences of rising inequality, especially with regards\nto who has political power. We will begin by examining the contours\nof inequality in the U.S. while also exploring the various ways that\npower manifests itself in politics. We’ll then explore the relationship\nbetween wealth and public policy outcomes in the United States, along\nwith the ways that the very wealthiest Americans – both individually\nand collectively – work to advance their policy views. Beyond just\nexamining national-level politics, we will also discuss inequality and\npower on the state- and local-levels. We’ll then explore how political\nand economic inequality are interrelated with race and social class,\nand how all of this connects to the rise of Donald Trump. Finally, we will\nassess potential remedies to political and economic inequality\nPOLS BC3540 COLL:CONSTRUCTNG STATES NATIONS. 4 points.\nPrerequisites: POLS V1501 or the equivalent.

In analyzing different factors, we will survey and learn from\nexisting relevant theoretical frameworks in social sciences particularly\npolitical science. we will cover a wide range of topics that are also\nmajor topics in political science such as federalism, authoritarianism,\nleadership, and trust in government. By examining this important\ncontemporary global crisis from political science perspectives,\nstudents can learn about broader theories in social sciences in general\nand political science in particular. Another goal of this course is for\nstudents to learn how to make social science inquiry and analysis\nwith comparative methods.

Many Psychology\nmajors continue for graduate training in psychology, neuroscience,\nor education, while others enter professional schools for training in\nmedicine, law, or business.\nMission \nThrough courses, advising and laboratories, the Department of\nPsychology educates students about the intellectual perspectives\nand empirical methods of the contemporary discipline of Psychology.\nIntroductory courses provide an overview of the ﬁeld and its major\ncomponents, emphasizing the practices by which hypotheses are\nformed and new evidence is created. Middle-level courses consider\nsigniﬁcant topics in sharp focus, while upper-level seminars use\nclassic and recent technical literature as a springboard for discussion\nin groups of advanced students. The Department also encourages\nstudents to participate in research and in the many different\nDepartmental and College-wide forums for discussion and reﬁnement\nof scientiﬁc work.\nStudent Learning Outcomes\nA student graduating with a major concentration in Psychology will\nknow how to:\n• Describe the historical foundations and contemporary problems in\npsychology;\n• Portray the sub-disciplines in psychology;\n• Explain the application of psychological knowledge to questions of\nbehavior and mental processes;\n• Identify and assemble current research literature about a topic\nwithin psychology;\n• Critique a psychological theory and the evidence offered to secure\nits premises;  \n• Design a study to test a psychological hypothesis;\n• Weigh the strengths and weaknesses of a research design and\nmethod;\n• Perform basic descriptive and inferential statistical tests to\nsummarize measures and to identify reliable results;\n• Communicate theories, hypotheses, empirical methods, and\nresearch ﬁndings in written and spoken form.", "source": "pdfs/barnard 2024-2025.pdf"}
{"page_index": 524, "page_content": "524  Psychology\nPrograms of Study\nThe Department of Psychology at Barnard offers a Major and a Minor in\nPsychology.\nStudent Advising \nAdvising Resources\nStudents typically declare their major at the end of their\nsophomore year, before program ﬁling. Keep your eyes open\nfor the program planning meeting where you can learn about\nthe major and meet the faculty. You can also declare your\nmajor earlier, or change your major at other times. If you are a\njunior planning to change to a psychology major from another\ndepartment, you should meet with the Department Vice Chair\nfor Student Advising (or your future advisor) to discuss your\nprogram and see if it is possible to ﬁnish the requirements in time\nto graduate.\nTo become a major in Psychology submit the major declaration\nform through Slate. You will be assigned a major advisor based\non faculty availability. Note that you are not required to meet with\nanyone in the Department prior to submitting this form. Also,\nplease be patient as it can take several days to complete the\nprocess of assigning a major advisor.\nA student will be assigned a major advisor when she declares\nher major at the end of the sophomore year. The major advisor\nwill approve her programs and monitor her progress with her\nrequirements during the junior and senior years. All Barnard\nPsychology full time faculty members are familiar with the broad\nrange of sub-disciplines within psychology and will generally be\nable to provide guidance in areas other than their own. Students\nwhose advisor goes on leave for a semester or academic year will\nbe assigned to a new advisor if necessary.\nGuidance for First-Year Students\nThe following are Introductory Psychology Courses and Courses\nRecommended for First Years:\n• PSYC BC1001 Introduction to Psychology\n• PSYC BC1010 Introductory Laboratory\n• PSYC BC1020 Behavioral Research Methods and Analysis\n• PSYC BC1088 Science of Living Well\n• PSYC BC1099 Science and Scientists\n• PSYC BC1101 Statistics \n \nEnrolling in Courses\nIn order to enroll in a lab or statistics course in the Department of\nPsychology at Barnard College, students must have taken PSYC\nBC1001 Introduction to Psychology, or its approved equivalent.\nFor PSYC BC1010 Introductory Laboratory to Experimental\nPsychology, students may concurrently be enrolled in PSYC\nBC1001.\nAlthough lecture and laboratories are listed as individual courses\nwith their own call numbers and credits, the courses are linked,\nconceptually and formally. This means that the only way to get\ncredit for lab is to receive a passing grade in the corresponding\nlecture course. Practically, this means that you must enroll\nin corresponding lecture and lab courses concurrently (in the\nsame semester). The only exception to this rule is PSYC BC1010\nIntroductory Laboratory to Experimental Psychology since there\nis no \"attached\" lecture to this lab course. However, PSYC BC1001\nIntro lecture must be completed before or in the same semester\nas BC1010 lab.\nNote that as of Fall 2021, PSYC BC1001, PSYC BC1101 Stats, and\nPSYC BC1020 Research Methods are prerequisites for all PSYC\nBC 2000-level lab courses.\nPreparation for Graduate Study \nThe Department of Psychology highly recommends that students\ninterested in clinical psychology take advantage of research and\nclinical experiences while at Barnard. Living in New York City affords\nstudents a tremendous number of opportunities for placements and we\nencourage students to take advantage of this while they can. Graduate\nschools will be evaluating applicants on their research experiences, as\nwell as their experience working with people in mental health settings.\nGetting involved in psychology outside of the classroom gives students\nthe opportunity to learn what type of work they like and don't like, what\nprofessional environments best suit them, and with what populations\nthey might like to help treat. Additionally, working with a mentor or\nsupervisor in a research and mental health  settings gives students a\nresource for stronger letters of recommendation.\nHelpful information about applying to graduate school can be found in\nthe Graduate Study Handout, which you can obtain from the Department\nAdministrator. In addition, Professor Kathleen Taylor is available to\nadvise students interested in graduate school in psychology.\nCoursework taken outside of Barnard\nAdvanced Placement Credit\nFor any student entering Barnard in Fall 2016 and\nthereafter: A  score of 4 or 5 on the Psychology Advanced\nPlacement (AP) exam or a score of 5 or 6 on the International\nBaccalaureate (IB) exam does allow you to be exempt from\nBC1001 Introduction to Psychology, however another PSYC\ncourse must be taken in its place. This includes students\nwho elect a Major or Minor in Psychology, as well as non-major\nstudents who choose to fulﬁll the College's General Education\nRequirements with Psychology. If you choose to take BC1001,\nthe College will also count your acceptable AP and IB scores as 3\ncredits toward your degree. Further information may be found on\nthe Registrar's website.\nFor students who entered Barnard College before fall 2016,\nthe major distinction is that the College will not give a student\ncredit for AP/IB as well as credit for BC1001. That is, if you enter\nBarnard with a score of 4 or 5 on the AP/IB and choose to take\nBC1001, you would not also get three points toward graduation.\nColumbia College Courses\nSelect courses may be credited toward the major/minor with the\npermission of the Chair or Assistant Chair.\nTransfer Credit\nThere are two steps in obtaining approval for courses taken\nat another institution. First, you must receive Barnard College\ncredit for the course from the Registrar. Second, you must obtain\napproval via Slate from the Psychology Department Vice Chair\nfor Student Advising to count the course toward your major", "source": "pdfs/barnard 2024-2025.pdf"}

(Approval from the Registrar will ensure College\ncredit, but will not ensure that the course can count toward the\nmajor.)\nStudents already enrolled at Barnard who plan to fulﬁll major\nrequirements with a course from another institution are strongly\nencouraged to seek approval from the Department Vice Chair\nfor Student Advising prior to ﬁling their program. This applies to\nsummer courses (including those taken at Columbia), courses\ntaken abroad, and courses taken at institutions other than\nBarnard or Columbia during the fall and spring semesters.\nAlso, note that transfer students follow the requirements (major\nand College/Gen Ed) that correspond to the year they entered\nBarnard (and not their class year).

Accordingly, there will be a limit on the\nnumber of study abroad courses taken at other institutions that\ncan be counted toward the major or minor.\n• To receive credit toward the major or minor for a study abroad\ncourse (whether taken through a Columbia program or another\ninstitution/program), students must submit a Study Abroad\nApproval form through Slate and obtain the approval of the Chair or\ndepartmental representative.\nSummer Credit\n• Summer courses at Barnard are equivalent to those taken during\nthe academic year. Courses that have been approved for the\nfulﬁllment of departmental requirements will automatically count\ntoward the major.\n• Courses taken at other institutions (including Columbia) are\nconsidered transfer credit and are subject to the same policies\ngoverning other transfer courses. To receive major or minor\ncredit for a summer course taken at another institution, students\nmust submit a Summer Course form through Slate and have it\napproved by both the Registrar’s Ofﬁce and the Chair or department\nrepresentative.\nResearch Methods in Psychology and the\nSenior Capstone Project\nCoursework in Research Methods\nThe Department offers the course, PSYC BC1020 Behavioral\nResearch Methods and Analysis, which is 3 points. This course\nintroduces students to the fundamental scientiﬁc principles,\nexperimental methods, and analytical approaches involved in the\nstudy of human behavior. The major topics covered, include: how\nbasic scientiﬁc approach can be gainfully and ethically used to\nstudy human behavior; as well the most prevalent manners of\ncollecting data in behavioral research, and the most common\ntypes of statistical analyses and tests such data is subjected\nto. The latter topics in the course introduce some of the more\nadvanced experimental designs and statistical approaches that\nare more speciﬁc to the social sciences. This course is offered\nevery semester and is a prerequisite to higher level PSYC courses.\nResearch Opportunities\nThere are many opportunities for a student to participate in\nresearch in laboratories and in the ﬁeld. Each member of the full\ntime faculty supervises research by students, and many nearby\nlaboratories, health centers and research institutions welcome\nthe participation of our students in their projects. Independent\nStudy, the Senior Research Seminar, and the Toddler Center\nSeminar are courses for student researchers.\nThe Senior Capstone Project\nTo have a course count towards fulﬁlling the Senior Requirement\nof the psychology major, it is to be taken in one of your last two\nsemesters at Barnard, and can be almost any 3000-level PSYC/\nNSBV seminar including PSYC BC3465-66, BC3473, BC3606\n(taken for 3 or 4 credits)\nAlso, you may fulﬁll the Senior Requirement with a Columbia\nPsychology seminar or supervised individual research but you\nshould consult with your major adviser ﬁrst. You will \"declare\"\nyour Senior Requirement when the Department Administrator\nsends an email to all seniors with a Google form link asking for\nthe course number, name and instructor.\nThe ﬁnal assignment in this course will serve as the Capstone\nProject. This project represents the culmination of academic work\nin the major. The form of the project may vary across courses, but\ncapstone projects generally allow students to develop records\nof individual research that include theoretical engagement, the\ndevelopment of creative projects or research, or original empirical\nand interpretative analysis. You will submit the project to your\ninstructor, and may be asked to submit an abstract of your\nproject to the Department to add to its senior archive of students’\nachievements. For this ﬁnal project, you will receive (in addition\nto the letter grade for the course) a grade of Pass (P), Pass with\nDistinction (PD), or Fail (with “P” and “PD” appearing on your\ntranscript). Additionally, many Psychology majors have the\nopportunity to celebrate their capstone project by presenting\nit at the annual Psychology Spring Research Festival in April.\nIf interested, please speak with your instructor, mentor, or the\ndepartment administrator for more details.\nDepartmental Honors and Prizes \nDepartmental Honors\nAs per the College, departments are permitted to nominate up to\n20% of an academic year's graduating class (October, February\nand May). The primary, and in most cases, only information\nused to determine nominations is the major GPA. This includes\npassing letter grades (C- and above) from all of the required\nPSYC courses. If a student has completed more than the required\ncourses and wishes for these grades to be included in her Major\nGPA, they must contact the Department Administrator. The non-\nPSYC courses required for the major are not included (note, these\ncan be taken as \"pass-fail\" assuming the student receives a\n\"pass\").

She must, however, enroll in another PSYC course,\nworth three or more credits, in its place.  Also please note, that even\nwith experience in a high school AP course, the Department highly\nrecommends that all students enroll in PSYC BC1001. If a student\nwith acceptable AP/IB scores chooses to enroll in BC1001, she will\nreceive both major and college credit for the course, as well as three\npoints toward graduation (for the AP/IB credit).\n2 If a student would like to enroll in a Statistics course outside of the\nBarnard Department of Psychology to fulﬁll this portion of the major\nrequirements she should obtain prior approval from the Chair or the\nVice Chair for Student Advising. Note that there are several courses\noffered by Columbia that are equivalent to PSYC BC1101 which\nmeans you cannot receive credit for both courses (you must choose\none or the other to apply towards your major requirements).\n3 Students are strongly advised to enroll in only one PSYC laboratory\ncourse per semester.\nAlso, students should check their calendar of commitments and\nreview the lab attendance policy before signing up for a lab. Each\nlaboratory follows the same policy about attendance:\n• You must attend every Laboratory meeting, and you must be\npresent for the duration of the meeting.\n• You may not arrive late.\n• You may not depart before you complete the day's procedure.\n• If you miss more than a single Laboratory session you will be\ndismissed from the Laboratory and you will not be permitted to\nremain enrolled.\n4 PSYC BC1010 is intended for First Year and Sophomore students\nwho have not previously taken any psychology labs. It is not a\nrequirement, however, if taken, it should be taken prior to one of the\nGroup 1 and 2 topical labs. PSYC BC1001 must be taken prior to or\nconcurrently with BC1010.\n5 A student may elect to fulﬁll the Senior Requirement with a Columbia\nPsychology Department Seminar or Supervised Individual Research\nwith a Columbia faculty member. prior approval for this is needed.\nFor all other 3000-level courses, you must notify the professor at the\nbeginning of the semester that the course will be used as your senior\nrequirement.\n6 A maximum of two of the following courses may count toward the\nmajor (though more could count toward College requirements):\n• PSYC BC3465 Field Work # Research Seminar: Toddler\nCenter (fall semester)\n• PSYC BC3466 FIELD WORK # RESEARCH SEMINAR: TODDLER\nCENTER (spring semester)\n• PSYC BC3606 INDEPENDENT STUDY  (Formerly PSYC\nBC3601-3608)\n7 The Psychology Department defaults to rules and exemptions\nallowed by the home department. Meaning, if Biology, for example,\naccepts a course substitution for one of its labs, Psychology will\nhonor this course as fulﬁlling part of the Outside Science component\nof the Psychology Major.

This seminar is focused\non understanding Fanon’s particular perspective on the psychology\nof the oppressed and its relevance for examining the experience\nof past and present racialized inequality and its effects in society.\nThe course is divided into four sections, which build cumulatively.\nI). An introductory section introduces Fanon’s central ideas (e.g.,\ndialecticism, existentialism, post-colonialism) in their intellectual\nand socio-historical context (e.g., the Algerian revolution, African\ndecolonization, South African Apartheid, the US civil rights and\nwomen’s rights movements). II). A second section locates Fanon in\npsychological theory and therapeutic theory and practice. The cultural\nand political (Eurocentric?) roots of psychological theory and practice\nare examined as are notions of oppression causing psychological\nand physical violence as well as psychopathology / psychological\ndisorder. III). A third section examines Fanon and others psychological\napproaches to identity with particular attention to the presumed\n“inferiority complex” of oppressed peoples, nationalist and other\nreconstructions of identity in opposition to oppression, sociological\npsychological conceptualizations of stigma, and Dubois’s influential\nideas regarding double consciousness. IV). A fourth and ﬁnal section\nfocuses on resistance and rebellion. The focus here is on the psycho-\nmoral implications of (violent, peaceful, non-disruptive) action against\noppression with reference to the distinct perspectives of Fanon in\ncomparison to influential ﬁgures like Gandhi and M.L.K Jr. These\nissues are linked to a post-Fanon approach to the psychology of the\noppressed called Liberation Psychology\nFall 2024: AFRS BC3160\nCourse\nNumber\nSection/Call\nNumber\nTimes/Location Instructor Points Enrollment\nAFRS 3160 001/00127 W 2:10pm - 4:00pm \n111 Milstein Center\nGhina Abi-\nGhannam\n4.00 10/20\nNeuroscience and Behavior (Barnard)\nNSBV BC1001 INTRODUCTION TO NEUROSCIENCE. 3.00 points.\nThis course is required for all the other courses offered in Neuroscience\nand Behavior.

Consequently, it is not an ahistorical object, nor a\npredetermined identity, nor a uniform category of analysis.

How can\nwe situate these recent changes within a longer trajectory of urban\nchange in the United States? What do we make of the contested\nclaims on space, belonging and identity made by, or on behalf of,\npeople living in changing urban places? How should we evaluate\ndevelopment interventions whose end results seem so often to\ndiverge from their intentions?     This course will develop practical\ninroads into the problem of the changing American city that will both\ncomplement and complicate commonplace intuitions about the\nurban change we witness unfolding around us. Readings stay close\nto anthropological and ethnographic perspectives. We will consider\nhow focusing on the meanings and experiences of everyday life in\nurban spaces can problematize ideals often associated with urban\nliving, including various forms of diversity. Additional readings will\nintroduce students to analytical perspectives on urbanism, race,\nethnicity, space and citizenship.

While ours is a\nnation of immigrants, one which privileges its history of westward\nexpansion and pioneering, trailblazing adventurers, we also seem\nto long for what Wallace Stegner called a “sense of place,” a true\nbelonging within a single locale. Each of these constructions has\ntended to focus on individuals with a tremendous degree of agency in\nterms of where and whether they go. However, it is equally important\nto understand the tension between movement and stasis within\ncommunities most frequently subjected to spatial upheavals. To that\nend, this course is designed to examine narratives of immigration,\nmigration, relocation, and diaspora by authors of color in the United\nStates.\nCSER UN3904 Rumor and Racial Conflict. 4 points.\nThis course will take a transnational look at the strange ways that race\nand mass rumors have interacted. From the judicial and popular riots in\nthe U.S. justiﬁed by recurrent rumors of African-American insurrection,\nto accusations that French Jews were players in the 'white slave trade,'\nto tales of white fat-stealing monsters among indigenous people of\nBolivia and Peru, rumors play a key role in constructing, enforcing, and\ncontesting regimes of racial identity and domination. In order to grasp\nrumor's importance for race, we will need to understand how it works,\nso our readings will cover both instances of racialized rumor-telling,\nconspiracy theories and mass panics, and some key approaches to\nhow rumors work as a social phenomenon. The instructor will expect\nyou to post a response to the reading on Courseworks each week\nand to engage actively in class discussion.

Instructions and the application\nform can be found here: https://english.barnard.edu/english/creative-\nwriting-courses. In this section of creative nonﬁction, we will explore\nthe essay. We will consider the essay in the original and most open-\nended sense of the term—coming from French, essai, meaning\n“attempt.\" This type of essay is also known as a personal essay.\nThe personal essay is a paradoxical form. It makes rules and then\nbreaks them. It announces itself and then slips out the backdoor. It\nis a mischief-maker and the successful essayist remembers that,\nremembers to stay playful. And that's what our workshop will be about.\nAs we attempt to write and share our stories, let’s ask one another:\n“what’s the fun of this story?” Let’s urge each other to see how can that\nfun remain, adhere, and grow through the drafting process. Most of all,\nlet's use the essay to explore our relationship to writing overall. Phillip\nLopate writes that the essay “sets up a relationship with the reader, a\ndialogue—a friendship.” Seeing the sentence as a set of relationships,\none tied to our human relations, we will write and revise with the hope\nof fostering an enduring relationship with the page. Writers should\nexpect to workshop at least twice, working toward a ﬁnal portfolio of\n15-20 double-spaced pages.

The\nReligion department's curriculum offers students the opportunity\nto explore the histories, texts, and practices of many of the world's\nreligious communities and to consider both the profound ways\nin which religion has worked historically and how it continues to\ninform and affect the cultural, political, and ethical debates of the\ncurrent moment. In addition, our curriculum invites students to\nreflect on the challenging theoretical questions that are generated\nby the category \"religion\" itself, an abstract category that has its own\ncomplicated history. The academic study of religion is self-consciously\ninterdisciplinary, drawing upon the methods and insights of literary\nstudies, historiography, social analysis, and cultural comparison.\nMoreover, the study of religion reminds us that religious identities\ndemand sustained critical analysis, intersecting complexly as they\ndo with race, class, gender, and ethnicity, among other categories of\nafﬁliation and identiﬁcation. In its teaching, research projects, and\npublic programming, the Religion department promotes engaged\nintellectual inquiry into the rich diversity of religious institutions, rituals,\nideas, and communities both past and present.\nThe Departments of Religion at Barnard and Columbia marshal an array\nof academic approaches to the study of religion, representing the depth\nand diversity of the world's religious traditions, past and present. The\ncategory of religion-along with key related terms like belief, spirituality,\nmystical experience, and ritual-is historically and culturally contingent;\nmany of our courses interrogate these terms and the conditions of\ntheir construction. Yet we are committed to engaging \"religion,\" which\npersists so strongly in common usage and public debate, and is so\nhard to capture in any related domain or theoretical system.\nMorningside Heights provides unique resources for the study of\nreligion. The University's specialized programs and centers, especially\nits regional institutes, create a context for exploring in depth the\nlinguistic, literary, political, and cultural milieus that bear on particular\nreligious traditions. The new Center for the Study of Science and\nReligion enriches curricular offerings in that ﬁeld. Barnard's Center\nfor Research on Women often focuses on issues of ethics and policy\nwhere questions of religion and gender are paramount, and Barnard\nReligion faculty are particularly active in the area.

And the city as a whole provides one of the world's\nbest laboratories for the study of religion.\nOur program tries to help students discover these resources and\nuse them well. Many courses fulﬁll the College's general education\nrequirements.\nMission\nGoals for the Academic Study of Religion at Barnard \nThe faculty in Religion at Barnard have organized the curriculum\naround several interlocking goals:\n• To help students learn to engage critically with different religious\ntraditions in their historical and cultural settings;\n• To attune students to the different theoretical, methodological, and\ndisciplinary approaches required for critically interrogating different\nreligious archives, performances, communal formations, artifacts,\nand ideas;\n• To provide students with the critical tools for understanding the\ninfluence of religion on individuals and society;\n• To open up the category of ―religion# to critical investigation,\nboth to consider its history and to understand how it comes to be\napplied to a variety of human and social phenomena.\nStudent Learning Outcomes\nWhat Students Learn when Pursuing the Academic Study of Religion at\nBarnard \nStudents who are successful in our curriculum will learn to:\n• Read/view/engage primary sources and scholarly materials\ncritically and with subtlety;\n• Situate religious texts, performances, artifacts, and ideas in\nhistorical, social, political, and cultural contexts;\n• Understand the importance of perspective when analyzing religious\nideas, claims, and sources;\n• Express themselves fluently in writing and speaking about the\nmaterials under investigation.\nIn addition, they will:\n• Develop an acquaintanceship with the history of theoretical\ndebates about \"religion\" —how the intellectual history of the ﬁeld\nhas shaped the object of knowledge for the ﬁeld—and\n• Become familiar with a range of methodological approaches\nappropriate to the object of study (e.g., literary interpretation and\nanalysis; historical contextualization; ethnographic participant\nobservation; philosophical inquiry; analysis of visual, artistic,\narchaeological, architectural evidence).\nChair: Najam Haider (Professor) \nProfessors: Beth Berkowitz, Elizabeth Castelli, John Stratton Hawley \nAssociate Professor: Gale Kenny \nAssistant Professors: Tiffany Hale, Tim Vasko \nTerm Assistant Professor: Meghan Hartman\nOther ofﬁcers of the University offering courses listed below:\nProfessors: Gil Anidjar, Peter Awn, Courtney Bender, Euan Cameron,\nMatthew Engelke, Katherine Ewing, Bernard Faure, Rachel McDermott,\nDavid (Max) Moerman, Wayne Proudfoot, Robert Somerville, Mark C.\nTaylor, Robert Thurman \nAssociate Professors:  Michael Como, Josef Sorett, Yannik Thiem \nAssistant Professors: Clémence Boulouque, Zhaohua Yang\nRequirements for the Major\nThe department's strengths in comparative study, textual and social\nanalysis, philosophy, theory, and cultural history allow students to\nbalance close study in one area with a broad investigation of the ﬁeld\nwe name \"religion.\" Working closely with an advisor in the department,\nmajors construct a cluster of ﬁve courses that relate to one another\nin a coherent fashion (#1, below) and support the senior thesis. To\ncomplement this depth, they select three courses that lend breadth\nto their studies in religion (#2). Students considering Religion as a\nmajor should contact the chair or a member of the department in their\nsophomore year to begin planning their programs. \nThe Religion major requires twelve courses (a minimum of 40 credits),\nas follows:\n1) Major cluster: ﬁve courses, including one seminar.

This cluster of courses may be organized around a particular\ntradition or geographic area: Hinduism, Islam, Religion in America,\netc. Alternatively, students may design clusters that focus on a set\nof related subjects and concerns, such as: Religion in New York;\nReligion in theory and practice; Religion and culture; Religious texts\nand histories; Religion and migration; Religion, women, gender; and\nReligion, race, nation, ethnicity.\nYet these are only exemplary. Students are urged to design their\nown clusters, supplementing departmental listings with religion-\nrelated courses posted on the Barnard Religion Department's website\nas Religion Related Courses. Courses taken outside of the religion\ndepartment must be approved by the student's adviser or department\nchair. Several sample majors are posted on the Barnard Religion\nDepartment's website.\n2) Breadth: three Religion courses - either lecture or seminar - that\nlend geographical, historical, and/or disciplinary range to a student's\nprogram.\n3) One semester of the course entitled “Religion Lab” (Religion\nGU4905), which focuses on methods, strategies, and materials utilized\nin the ﬁeld of religious studies.  Through guided exercises and selected\nexemplary readings, students learn research skills for locating and\nidentifying primary and secondary sources.  They are also exposed to\nimportant scholarly frameworks necessary for properly analyzing these\nsources.  Majors are encouraged to take this course by their junior year\nas it serves to prepare them for their senior thesis.\n4) One semester of the course entitled “Theory” (UN3799), engaging\nmajor theoretical issues in the ﬁeld.\n5) The two-semester Senior Research Seminar (BC 3997-8), which must\nbe taken in sequence, beginning in autumn and continuing through\nthe spring, and which structures the experience of preparing a senior\nthesis.

We will\nexplore the role that narratives – mythological, historical, personal,\nand academic – have played in the creation, maintenance and\nconceptualization of sacred spaces in South Asia. Each class in the\nﬁrst section of the course is devoted to a particular site or category\nof sites, and examines the roles that religious texts and iconography\nplay in the traditions with which the sites are associated. In the second\nsection of the course, we will consider ethnographic perspectives on\nreligious journeys.

What are are the multiple\ntypes of narratives that come to be associated with sacred spaces, and\nwhat roles do they play in their production? How are such narratives\ntransmitted, and for whom?

Our guiding questions will be:\nWhat does religion have to do with queerness? What does queerness\nhave to do with religion? Queer theory and activists, unless they already\nidentify as religious, often have little or little good to say about religion.\nConversely, many religious traditions intensively regulate gender,\nsex, sexuality, and especially queerness. this course will explore how\nreligious studies can enrich queer theory and how queer theory can\nreshape our thinking about religious studies. But beyond the mutual\ndisinterest, anxieties, and animosities, queer studies and religious\nstudies share actually a whole range of core interests and questions,\nsuch as embodiment, sexuality, gender-variability, coloniality, race\nappearing as religious identity and religious identity as gendered,\nas well as the role of catastrophe, utopia, and redemption in our\nexperience of the world. We will examine questions about religion\ncome to the fore when we paying especially attention to queerness,\ngender, sexuality, pleasure, pain, and desire. Equally, we will examine\nhow queer discourses mobilize religious and theological images and\nideas, especially where these images and ideas are no longer clearly\nrecognizable as having religious origins.

Students should come\naway from the course with an expanded sense of how we grapple\nwith issues related to gender, sexuality, desire, and embodiment in our\neveryday lives and how religion and religious formations are entangled\nwith these issues well beyond religious communities.

In the process, it\ninterrogates the degree to which the orientalist past and the secular\npresent shapes our understanding of the Muslim world. Students\nwill not just engage with material objects from Muslim societies but\nalso consider the choices museums make about their display and\npresentation. These choices, in turn, speak to the role of museums\nin deﬁning a speciﬁc understanding of the “sacred.” Finally, students\nwill learn to thoughtfully and critically pose questions about the roles\nthat museums as public institutions play in sharping public and private\nunderstandings of Islam. The course begins with a general discussion\nof material objects in the study of religion. This is followed by a broad\nsurvey of Islamic Art which both describes and critiques the category\nas it has been framed in the Academy. Students then visit a number\nof museums to learn about the style and content of their Islamic\ncollections. The course concludes by engaging a different kind of\ncuration, namely oral histories in the Brooklyn Museum", "source": "pdfs/barnard 2024-2025.pdf"}

In reality, Islamic law is an organic and constantly\nevolving human project aimed at ascertaining God’s will in a given\nhistorical and cultural context. This course offers a detailed and\nnuanced look at the Islamic legal methodology and its evolution over\nthe last 1400 years. The ﬁrst part of the semester is dedicated to\n“classical” Islamic jurisprudence, concentrating on the manner in which\njurists used the Qur’an, the Sunna (the model of the Prophet), and\nrationality to articulate a coherent legal system. The second part of the\ncourse focuses on those areas of the law that engender passionate\ndebate and controversy in the contemporary world. Speciﬁcally, we\nexamine the discourse surrounding Islamic family (medical ethics,\nmarriage, divorce, women’s rights) and criminal (capital punishment,\napostasy, suicide/martyrdom) law. The course ends by discussing\nthe legal implications of Muslims living as minorities in non-Islamic\ncountries and the effects of modernity on the foundations of Islamic\njurisprudence. This class is designed for students interested in a close\nexamination of the Islamic legal system; it is not a broad introduction\nto the Islamic religion.

We will examine the historical origins, development and\ninstitutionalization of Suﬁsm, including long-standing debates over its\nplace within the wider Islamic tradition. By way of a close reading of\na wide range of primary and secondary sources, we will examine Suﬁ\nattitudes toward the body, Suﬁ understandings of lineage, power and\nreligious authority, as well as the continued importance of Suﬁsm in the\nmodern world\nRELI GU4326 SUFISM IN SOUTH ASIA. 4.00 points.\nSuﬁsm or tassawuf has misleadingly been described as the mystical\nside of Islam, implying that it is somehow detached from the material\nworld. Throughout the history of Islam, Suﬁ ideas, practices, and\ninstitutions have borne a complex, intimate, and sometimes fraught\nrelationship with other aspects of Islamic tradition and practice, a\nrelationship that has also been profoundly impacted by Orientalist\nscholarship in the colonial period and by global reformist currents in\nthe postcolonial period. This seminar for advanced undergraduates\nand graduate students is an interdisciplinary investigation of how\nSuﬁsm has been affected by the historical, sociocultural, political, and\neveryday environments in which is it experienced and practiced, with\na particular focus on South Asia. Eclectic in approach, we will begin\nby considering how Suﬁsm has been construed and even constructed\nby scholars, considering how modern notions of the self, religion, and\nthe political have shaped scholarly understandings of what Suﬁsm\nis. Focusing on bodily practices and well known individual Suﬁs who\nlived in South Asia during different historical periods, we will use them\nas a vehicle for understanding Suﬁ experience within the context of\nthe evolving Suﬁ orders within speciﬁc local spaces. We will consider\nwhy Suﬁsm has become such a target of controversy and ambivalence\namong Muslims in the modern world and trace some of the changing\ncontroversies and tensions that Suﬁs have struggled with over time,\nfocusing on their understandings of self, society and reality", "source": "pdfs/barnard 2024-2025.pdf"}

A number of the 19th-century European “founding\nfathers” were invited or present, as was Swami Vivekananda, who\nhas been at least as signiﬁcant as any of them for the development\nof the ﬁeld as a global idea. The PWR’s American location broadens\nTomoko Masuzawa’s magisterial description of the “invention of world\nreligions” by initially shifting attention away from its European base.\nIt also introduces us to the element of display involved in announcing\nthis idea and to one of its most important institutional partners:\nthe University of Chicago. (2) In the second part of the course we\ninvestigate the consolidation/invention of the conceptual entities that\ncomprise “world religions,” as well as debates about just how many\nof them they are, and by what principle of accounting: To exemplify\nthe production of “isms” that are said to comprise the world religions,\nwe investigate the conceptual origins of Hinduism, Buddhism, Islam,\nthe Judeo-Christian Tradition, and most recently The Indigenous.\n(3) At the end we consider an institution founded around the idea of\nWorld Religions—Harvard’s Center for the Study of World Religions\n—and wonder how it compares to what has been done at Columbia\nand its neighbor institutions in New York: the Interfaith Center of\nNew York, the Jewish Theological Seminary, and Union Theological\nSeminary.

This\nseminar course introduces the latter discipline, thus complementing\nand completing Prof. Yarnall’s Columbia seminars on Buddhist\nEthics (RELI UN3500) and Indo-Tibetan Buddhist Philosophy (RELI\nGU4630), either of which—in addition to his introductory lecture\ncourse on Indo-Tibetan Buddhism (RELI UN2205)—are encouraged as\nprerequisites. This course will provide a detailed presentation of key\nBuddhist contemplative sciences, including: stabilizing meditation\n(śamatha); analytic insight meditation (vipaśyanā); cultivation\nof the four immeasurables, and form and formless trances; mind\ncultivation (lo jong); mindfulness meditation; Zen meditation; great\nperfection (dzogchen); and the subtle body-mind states activated and\ntransformed through advanced tantric yoga techniques.

The\nclass is structured around key theoretical readings from a range of\nacademic disciplines ranging from art history and anthropology to\ncomparative literature and religion. The course begins by placing\nthe controversies surrounding the visual depiction of Muhammad in\nhistorical perspective (Gruber). This is followed by an examination\nof modern portrayals of Muslims in ﬁlm that highlights both the\nviliﬁcation of the “other” (Shaheen) and the persistence of colonial\ndiscourses centered on the “native informant” (Mamdani). Particular\nemphasis is given to recent pop cultural works that challenge these\nsimplistic discourses of Islam. The second half of the course revisits\nMuhammad, employing an anthropological framework (Asad) to\nunderstand the controversies surrounding Salman Rushdie’s Satanic\nVerses. The obsession with a gendered depiction of Islam is then\nexamined through an anthropological framework that sheds light on\nthe problems of salvation narratives (Abu Lughod).

It is an abstract concept that reflects the\nAmerican mythology of progress and is rooted in religious ideas about\nland, labor, and ownership. Throughout the nineteenth century, these\nideas became more than just abstractions. They were tested, hardened,\nand revised by U.S. ofﬁcials and the soldiers they commanded on\nAmerican battleﬁelds. This violence took the form of the Civil War as\nwell as the series of U.S. military encounters with Native Americans\nknown as the Indian Wars. These separate yet overlapping campaigns\nhave had profound and lasting consequences for the North American\nlandscape and its peoples. This course explores the relationship\nbetween religious ideology and violence in the last half of nineteenth\ncentury.

The department\ninsists upon a strong foundation in language study, because this best\nprepares students for future involvement with the countries of Eastern\nEurope and Eurasia, as well as for graduate study in the literature,\nanthropology, sociology, history, economics, or politics of the region,\nand for careers in government, business, journalism, or international\nlaw.\nThe department offers major tracks in Russian Language and\nLiterature, Slavic and East European Literature and Culture, Russian\nRegional Studies, and Slavic and East European Regional Studies. ", "source": "pdfs/barnard 2024-2025.pdf"}

While offering a range\nof courses designed to give the student a strong general background\nin Russian and Slavic literature, ﬁlm, culture, and intellectual history,\nthe department encourages students to supplement their knowledge\nby taking courses devoted to Russia, the former Soviet Union, and\nEastern Europe offered in other disciplines as well. The department co-\nsponsors and facilitates student participation in region-related extra-\ncurricular activities held at the Harriman Institute and the Columbia\nSlavic Department and also fosters student engagement with the rich\ncultural resources available in New York City.\nStudent Learning Outcomes\nIn recognition of the National Standards for Foreign Language Learning\npublished by the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign\nLanguages, the Slavic Department expects the following outcomes for\nstudents in each of its major tracks:\n• Communication.  Students should be able to communicate orally\nand in writing in the language of study, and understand and\ninterpret written and spoken language on a variety of topics.\n• Cultures.  Students should demonstrate an understanding of the\nperspectives, products, and practices of the culture studied.\n• Connections.  Students should be able to acquire information and\nrecognize the distinctive viewpoints available to them through the\nforeign language and its cultures.\n• Comparisons.  Students should develop comparative insights\ninto the nature of language and culture as a result of studying a\nlanguage and culture other than their own.\n• Communities.  Students should be prepared to participate in\nmultilingual communities at home and around the world.\nIn addition, the Department expects the following outcomes of all\nmajors:\n• Students should demonstrate broad knowledge of at least one\nmajor aspect (e.g. literature, politics, or history) of the culture\nstudied\n• Students should acquire and convey, in an appropriate academic\nform, deep knowledge of a particular topic or question relating to\nthe culture studied\nEntering students should see Professor Frank Miller (708 Hamilton,\n854-3941) for a placement examination: a sufﬁciently high grade will\nautomatically fulﬁll the language requirement; other students will be\nplaced accordingly.

This course will take the\nunprecedented, paradoxical linguistic capital of New York City as a\nlens for examining how immigrants form communities in a new land,\nhow those communities are integrated into the wider society, and how\nthey grapple with linguistic and cultural loss. Interdisciplinary with\nan experiential learning component, the course will focus on texts,\nmaterials, encounters, and ﬁeldwork with three of the city’s newest\nand least-studied indigenous immigrant communities (indigenous\nLatin Americans, Himalayans, and Central Asians).Indigeneity, though\noften invisible or perceived as marginal in global cities like New\nYork, is in fact pervasive and fundamental. Cities now constitute a\ncrucial site for understanding migration and cultural change, with\nlanguage a vehicle for culture. Studying cultures only in situ (i.e. in\ntheir homelands) risks missing a crucial dimension. Students will be\nimmersed in stateless, oral, immigrant cultures while also gaining a\nhands-on critical understanding of language endangerment and urban\nsociolinguistic research, ﬁrst through ﬁeld experiences and guest\nspeakers (Endangered Language Alliance partners) and then by going\nout together into communities to work on projects in small teams.\nThe Endangered Language Alliance (ELA), where the instructor is Co-\nDirector, was formed as a non-proﬁt research institute in 2010 as a\nforum for researchers, community members, activists, artists, and other\nNew Yorkers to come together to support indigenous and minority\nlanguages. ELA’s video recordings provide ﬁrst-hand testimony of\nendangered languages in the global city – in indigenous languages\nwith English translation – available in few other places.

Each type of\nthe trickster is illustrated by literary examples from different world\ncultures (European and non-European alike) as well as theoretical\nworks of Mikhail Bakhtin, Michel Foucault, Giorgio Agamben, and Peter\nSloterdijk.

In this course we will explore\nhow these decadent tendencies shaped the elegant and transgressive\nliterary culture of Russia’s pre-revolutionary Silver Age. The decadent\npredilection for self-destructive behavior and the pervasive sense of\nimpending doom took on new meaning within the Russian cultural\ncontext, on the eve of the communist revolution.

In respect of having such a discourse about ourselves,\nminimally, it may be true.

This course does not attempt to adjudicate\nwhat is the true or best theory of the modern, but rather inquires\ninto the discursive and historical conditions for telling narratives\nabout modernity’s advent and constructing theories of its nature, and\ntheir aporiai.

Despite all this diversity, the discipline of sociology has\na powerful coherence that comes from a collective dedication to\ndeveloping theoretical principles about social life and testing them\nwith empirical evidence. This commitment to systematic empirical\nresearch represents the strength of the discipline and the chance\nfor a distinctive undergraduate experience for Sociology majors\nat Barnard. It exposes them to a range of approaches that include\nquantitative data collection and analysis, participant observation,\nintensive interviewing, historical-archival research, and discourse\nanalysis.\nMission\nAll students taking courses in Sociology at Barnard can expect to\nlearn about the relevance of empirical rigor and theoretical analysis for\npublic policy, political and social debate, and civic engagement more\nbroadly deﬁned.\nSociology majors will develop critical analytic and research skills that\nthey can take with them into a wide range of careers, whether they\ncontinue on to graduate study in sociology or choose to enter such\nﬁelds as business, education, law, nonproﬁt enterprise or public policy.\nPrograms of Study\nThe Department provides students with expertise in\nthree areas:\n1. a common foundation in the discipline’s core theories and\nmethodologies through the following three required courses:\n• SOCI UN1000 THE SOCIAL WORLD\n• SOCI UN3000 SOCIAL THEORY\n• SOCI UN3010 METHODS FOR SOCIAL RESEARCH\n2. exposure to a range of substantive questions that motivate\nsociological research through a 3-tiered elective structure:\n• 2000-level courses introduce non-majors and majors\nto substantive concerns through sociological texts and\nperspectives;\n• 3000-level courses are normally lecture courses that introduce\nupper level students (majors and non-majors) to dominant\ntheoretical models and debates in more specialized subﬁelds;\n• 3900-level courses are seminars that provide more intensive\nengagement with primary research in specialized subﬁelds\nof the discipline and involve some signiﬁcant primary or\nsecondary research paper\n3. direct research experience both within the classroom and under\nfaculty supervision in the Senior Thesis Seminar or designated\nsenior research seminars.\nStudent Learning Outcomes\nStudents who graduate with a major in sociology will be able to:\n• Discuss the core theories of the discipline and apply them to\ncontemporary issues.\n• Identify the central questions that motivate sociological research in\nat least one specialized subﬁeld.\n• Describe and evaluate the strengths and limits of social science\nresearch.\n• Apply the methods of social science research to a question of\nsubstantive or theoretical importance.\n• Design, execute, and present original research projects.\nStudents who graduate with a minor in sociology will be able to:\n• Discuss the core theories of the discipline and apply them to\ncontemporary issues.\n• Identify the central questions that motivate sociological research in\nat least one specialized subﬁeld.\n• Describe and evaluate the strengths and limits of social science\nresearch.\nStudent Advising\nAdvising Resources\nYou can ﬁnd information about the Requirements for Degree in\nSociology on our website.

The traditional\nbiomedical model places the responsibility of these disparities on\nthe choices that an individual makes. The model assumes that one’s\nsmoking, eating and exercising habits are based on personal choice.\nTherefore, the prevalence of morbidities such as high blood pressure,\nobesity and diabetes is the result of an individual’s poor decisions. This\ncourse will explore how the conditions under which individuals live,\nwork, play and pray impact their health outcomes. Collectively these\nconditions are referred to as the Social Determinants of Health (SDoH)\nand often they reveal the systemic inequalities that disproportionately\naffect marginalized communities. This course will also call upon the\nneed for a paradigm shift from the “Social” Determinants of Health to\nthe “Structural” Determinants of Health. This shift is in recognition that\nit is the underlying structures (laws, material infrastructure) that impact\nhealth outcomes. The development of the SDoH has challenged health\ncare providers to look beyond the biomedical model that stresses\nan individual’s behavior as the main predictor of adverse health\nconditions. Instead the SDoH focuses on an “upstream” approach\nthat examines the underlying systemic and racial inequalities that\nimpact communities of color and their health outcomes. An analysis\nthat focuses upstream reveals that government policies and social\nstructure are at the core of health disparities. Through the lens of New\nYork City and its health systems, this course will cover a wide range\nof topics related to race and health, including: racial inequalities in\nhousing and homelessness, biases in medical institutions, and the\nunconscious bias that lead providers to have racialized perception of\nan individual’s pain tolerance. In addition to exposing these inequalities\nthe course will also provide innovative solutions that seek to mitigate\nthese barriers including: home visiting programs, medical respite\nprograms for homeless patients and food as medicine in health\ncare systems. Students will demonstrate their knowledge through\nindividual writing, and class discussion.

The ideal screams of opportunity and meritocracy:\nno matter how poor one begins life, as long as they work and save, they\ncan enjoy the security and safety of home. To many, this ideal gives\nthem hope, for they can see possibility for their achievement. To others,\nthe ideal feels like a farce, for they rightly anticipate facing countless\nbarriers to achieving that dream. This course examines challenges,\ncontradictions, and ironies of American housing equity. We study ways\nin which the ideal of single-family home ownership has directly led to\nexcluding large portions of the population from secure housing. We\nexamine why and how many Americans can be deeply committed to\nequality and freedom and still perpetuate inequalities in their housing\nchoices. We examine how people at the bottom who understand well\nthe barriers they face still manage to survive, invent, and struggle to\nachieve dignity and equity in their housing. The course examines core\nissues of housing equity in America historically and in the present. The\ncourse primarily offers a sociological perspective on housing. But we\nwill also read work and bring in perspectives from geography, history,\nurban planners, and others. In addition, we will also engage with work\nby journalists, which represents one way that the multi-disciplinary\nissues of housing are connected in narratives intended for a wider\naudience than more scholarly products.

It\nmay serve a springboard for you to tackle such questions as: What is\nthe relationship between meaning and money, work time and leisure\ntime? (Or, will I work to live or live to work?) How do historical and\nrelatively ﬁxed work temporalities and geographies compare to new\nstructures of work?

This course critically examines the politics of global health\nand its impact on local institutions and people. Drawing on social\nscience research, the course will address three main themes: 1)\nhow global health priorities are deﬁned and constructed, 2) how our\nunderstandings of disease influence our response to that disease,\nand 3) how efforts to respond to disease intersect with people on the\nground, sometimes in unexpected ways. We will examine the global\nhealth industry from the vantage point of different institutions and\nactors – international organizations, governments, local healthcare\ninstitutions, healthcare workers, and people living with or at risk of\nvarious illnesses like HIV/AIDS, malaria, cancer, and Ebola.

We will pay special\nattention to the ways in which students class, race/ethnicity and\ngender shape their educational experiences. We will also look at how\nschools are organized, how schools construct differences among\nstudents, and how schools sort kids into different (and unequal)\ngroups.

Throughout its history, it has afforded students\na solid preparation in both Spanish language and the literatures and\ncultures of Spain, Spanish America, and the Spanish-speaking United\nStates.\nMission\nThe keystone of our integrated curriculum is linguistic and intellectual\ncontinuity from the elementary language level to the most advanced\nliterature and culture courses. Our language courses are  skill - and\nproﬁciency- oriented and provide the foundation students need for\nadvanced study, either at Barnard or in college-level study abroad. Our\nupper-level courses stress the necessary historical and theoretical\ntools needed to understand the cultural and aesthetic production of the\nHispanic world. Through our strong collaboration with interdisciplinary\nprograms and departments at Barnard, including Comparative\nLiterature, Africana Studies, Women’s, Gender and Sexuality Studies,\nand the Forum on Migration, as well as our teamwork with the\nColumbia Department of Latin American and Iberian Cultures, we are\nideally poised to train students for a wide range of post-graduation\nexperiences in MA/PhD programs or in the professional sphere.\nStudent Learning Outcomes\nThrough the Major in Spanish and Latin American Cultures, students\nwho rigorously apply themselves to their studies will be able to:\n• Use the Spanish language at the B2-C2 proﬁciency levels\n(Independent User/Proﬁcient User), as deﬁned by the Common\nEuropean Framework of Reference (depending on initial\nbackground and ability);*\n• Identify and describe the cultures of Spain and Spanish America\nthroughout their history, from Islamic Spain and the colonial period\nthrough the present.\n• Demonstrate specialized knowledge of selected literary and\ncultural works, authors and cultural producers of the Hispanic\nworld, understood in their aesthetic, historical, and social contexts.", "source": "pdfs/barnard 2024-2025.pdf"}

Literacy at the level of\nlanguage instruction entails the students' ability to express themselves\nfluently in Spanish, both orally and in writing. Literacy at the cultural\nlevel entails an intellectual grasp of Spanish and Spanish American\ncultural and artistic products and the knowledge of the historical and\nmethodological contexts in which to situate them. Students must\nconsult with the major adviser to carefully plan their program upon\nmajor declaration. With adviser approval, courses taken abroad or at\nanother institution can apply toward the major/minor. The Department\nof Spanish and Latin American Cultures addresses the Barnard senior\nresearch requirement through the writing of a substantial paper in a\ntopic-based senior seminar; there is the possibility of further research\ndevelopment for some students. The Spanish and Latin American\nCultures majors have been designed in conjunction with the Columbia\nDepartment of Spanish and Portuguese.  Hence, Barnard students may,\nalways in consultation with the major adviser, move freely between the\ndepartments of both institutions in search of the courses that best ﬁt\ntheir interests and schedules.\nProﬁcient User\nC2 Can understand with ease virtually everything heard or read.

Possible ﬁelds and programs include Anthropology,\nAfricana Studies, Art History, Economics, Film, Gender Studies, History,\nLatino Studies, Latin American Studies, Music, Political Science,\nSociology, and Urban Studies. Students should work closely with\ntheir major advisor to plan their program of study; it will be their\nresponsibility to seek advising regarding coursework in their external\nspecialization from appropriate sources (for example, from other\ndepartments' Chairs). Electives outside the two departments (Spanish\nand Latin American Cultures/Latin American and Iberian Cultures)\nshould include basic methodological or foundation courses in the\nchosen ﬁeld or program.

While Barnard and\nColumbia students fulﬁll the overall graduation requirements at their\nrespective institutions (the Core at Columbia, Foundations at Barnard),\nmajor requirements are the same for all majors, who take foundational\ncoursework in the literary, cultural, and embodied traditions of western\nand non-Western performance as well as courses in the practices of\nacting, directing, design, dramaturgy, playwriting, and management\nand technical theatre. All majors then specialize in a speciﬁc area and\nundertake advanced thesis work, leading either to a formal essay of\noriginal research, or to an artistic project (in acting, design, directing,\ndramaturgy, playwriting, solo performance, or stage and production\nmanagement) that combines the practices of research and artistic\ncreation. Barnard and Columbia students receive their degrees from\ntheir respective colleges of Columbia University.\nThe Barnard College Department of Theatre mounts a full season of\nproductions in the Minor Latham Playhouse and the Glicker-Milstein\nTheatre, a crucible of investigation that is a credit-bearing element of\nthe curriculum, and open to all undergraduate students for audition. A\ncollaboration between students and professional theatre artists, the\nDepartment of Theatre productions are both a learning process and a\nscene of encounter, where perceptions are shaped for the attention and\ncreative reflection of a larger public.\nBarnard students may declare the major at any time; Columbia\nstudents have a major-selection period in the second year, but all\nstudents must declare the major by the spring semester of the\nsophomore year. The major requirements are spelled out below, and\nthe process for choosing a thesis area as well: all Theatre/Drama and\nTheatre Arts majors complete a thesis as a capstone to their work in\nthe degree. For more information about the major, please contact the\nTheatre Department ofﬁce.\nAll majors must submit the online Theatre Major Declaration Form,\navailable on the Department of Theatre website (theatre.barnard.edu);\nBarnard majors must also submit the Barnard Major Declaration\nForm via Slate. Prior to declaring the major, students should make an\nappointment with the Department Chair or their undergraduate advisor.\nAll majors should introduce themselves to the Theatre Administrator\nin 333C Milbank Hall; she will add names to the departmental listserv,\nand help students to keep up to date in important information about\nstudying in the Department.\nMission\nMission: To engage imaginatively with the inheritance of the past, the\nquestions of the present, and the possibilities of the future through\nembodied and intellectual inquiry into theatre and performance.\nWhat do we value? \nIn the Department of Theatre, faculty, staff, and students understand\ndrama, theatre, and performance as artistic and social practices,\nand as means and objects of study that model the investigation and\nproduction, the making, of a sustainable, equitable, livable future.  We\npursue theatre and performance within the purpose of the university:\nto learn, explore, and fashion disciplines of inquiry, new ways of\nknowing and so new structures of knowledge.

While our productions require\nauditions, the program generally is open for enrollment, meaning\ninterested students in or outside of the major may participate in\ncourses as they choose. \nActing Pre-Requisites:\nAll students wishing to take Acting courses in the Theatre Department\nmust ﬁrst complete an Acting I class before moving on to the Acting II\nseries. (Transfer students, please discuss transfer credit equivalencies\nwith the Theatre Department ofﬁce.) \nPlease see here for an up-to-date listing of our Acting course\ndescriptions. Please note that Acting II: Acting Sondheim and Acting\nII: Contemporary Musical Theatre requires all interested students to\nsubmit a video singing audition as well as other information, detailed\nboth on our website and in the course catalogue.\nFinally, students majoring in theatre are required to apply for the\nconcentration ﬁeld in which they will complete a senior thesis.\nThe application for senior thesis ﬁelds (acting, design, directing,\ndramaturgy, playwriting, solo performance, research) is due in January\nof the junior year (after 5th semester; 3 semesters remaining); students\nmust be declared majors, and have taken formal coursework in\nthe department in the potential ﬁeld(s) of the senior thesis. Please\nsee here for more information about the senior thesis: https://\ntheatre.barnard.edu/senior-thesis-0\nPreparation for Graduate Study\nStudents interested in PhD studies in the ﬁeld of literature, theatre,\nor performance studies should consult Profs. W. B. Worthen, Shayoni\nMitra, and/or Yizhou Huang; students interested in MFA in design\nshould consult Prof. Sandra Goldmark; in directing should consult\nProf. Alice Reagan; in acting should consult Prof. Gisela Cardenas. All\nfaculty are generally willing to be consulted on your next steps.\nCoursework Taken Outside of Barnard\nAdvanced Placement Credit\nWe do not count AP courses toward the major or the minor.\nColumbia College Courses\nSeveral lecture/seminar courses at Columbia University may be\ncounted toward the lecture/seminar requirement in the major or minor.\nMajors may count up to two courses not taken in the Department\nof Theatre toward the major; minors may count one. A list of such\ncourses (typically Shakespeare, drama courses offered in the English\ndepartment, and so on) is developed for each semester. Columbia\nEnglish (ENTA) and Barnard English (ENTH) courses are typically\ncounted; other courses should be approved by the Theatre Department\nofﬁce.\nTransfer Credit\nWhen students wish to transfer credit to Barnard from other\ninstitutions, their coursework is ﬁrst evaluated for college elective\ncredit by the Registrar’s Ofﬁce. If they are approved, departments can\nconsider these courses for credit toward the major or minor.\nStudents are allowed to count up to 2 courses taken elsewhere toward\nthe Theatre major, provided they are similar in duration, number of\nmeetings, and content to courses that fulﬁll the major offered in\nthe department. Courses are evaluated by the Theatre Department\nofﬁce. Students must take all courses counting toward the minor\nat Barnard/Columbia. The THTR UN3150 and THTR UN3151 Critical\nHistories of Drama, Theatre, and Performance cannot be substituted\nfor coursework elsewhere.\nStudy Abroad Credit\nClasses taken abroad through Columbia-led programs (i.e., those\nadministered by Columbia’s Center for Global Engagement) are treated\nas Columbia courses, equivalent to those taken on the Morningside\nHeights campus.\nClasses taken abroad through other institutions or programs are\ntreated as transfer credit and are subject to the same policies as other\ntransfer courses. Accordingly, there will be a limit on the number of\nstudy abroad courses taken at other institutions that can be counted\ntoward the major or minor.\nTo receive credit toward the major or minor for a study abroad course\n(whether taken through a Columbia program or another institution/\nprogram), students must submit a Study Abroad Approval form through\nSlate and obtain the approval of the Theatre Department ofﬁce.\nStudents planning to study abroad should consult with the Theatre\nDepartment ofﬁce regarding coursework taken abroad. Students\nstudying in conservatory programs in London (RADA, BADA, etc.)\ntypically take the equivalent of 9 credits of acting (3 studio courses)\nand, if they take two “studies” courses, are awarded one “lecture/\nseminar” course for that work. They may count ONE course toward the\nstudio requirement and ONE toward the lecture/seminar requirement.\nSummer Credit\nSummer courses at Barnard are equivalent to those taken during the\nacademic year. Courses that have been approved for the fulﬁllment of\ndepartmental requirements will automatically count toward the major/\nminor.\nCourses taken at other institutions (including Columbia) are considered\ntransfer credit and are subject to the same policies governing other\ntransfer courses. To receive major or minor credit for a summer course\ntaken at another institution, students must submit a Summer Course\nform through Slate and have it approved by both the Registrar’s Ofﬁce\nand the Theatre Department ofﬁce.\nSenior Capstone Project\nBarnard College has a long-standing commitment to preparing\nstudents in the major so that they may undertake a capstone project.\nAll Barnard seniors are required to complete a senior project or thesis,\nan opportunity the Theatre/Drama & Theatre Arts major extends to\nall majors, whether from Barnard, Columbia College, or Columbia\nGeneral Studies. The senior thesis project allows students to develop\nrecords of individual research that include theoretical engagement in\nthe major discipline, the development of creative projects or research,\nand original empirical and interpretive analysis. The thesis review will\nbe conducted by the full-time faculty of the department (Cardenas,\nGoldmark, Huang, Mitra, Reagan, H. Worthen, W.B. Worthen), in\nconsultation with faculty in speciﬁc thesis ﬁelds.\nPlease see here for more detail on thesis options by concentration, and\nfor information regarding the application: https://theatre.barnard.edu/\nsenior-thesis-0", "source": "pdfs/barnard 2024-2025.pdf"}

Initially many of their plays portrayed the plight of\npoor Black women either in the American South or in New York City’s\nHarlem, in each case showing a struggle for dignity in the midst of\nan unfair, dismissive, racist situation in which lynchings of Black\nmen were a common enough occurrence and citizen rights were\ndoubly denied these (generally educated) writers—both as Blacks\nand as women. Even plays depicting middle-class Black families or\nworking women showed how just holding one’s head up and keeping\nfood on the table (much less seeking fulﬁllment or advancement)\nwas exhausting and often demeaning. Plays written with Black\naudiences in mind often sought to provide “uplift” and encouragement.\nThose anticipating white or mixed audiences frequently wanted to\nshow Blacks as equal to whites in intellect, cleanliness, childrearing,\nhonor, patriotism, and citizenship. Over the course of a century, Black\nplaywrights have addressed racism, African American history, urban\nblight, a changing workplace, and Black American womanhood in a\nvariety of styles ranging from so-called kitchen sink realism to comedy,\nfantasy, and abstraction. The readings in the course do not exhaust\nthe possibilities for study but they will get you attuned to a rich trove\nof varied, important writing.

Students study the evolution\nof urban forms and social structures, which create opportunities and\nconstraints for the exercise of human agency. They examine the city in\ndifferent historical and comparative contexts, as well as in the human\nimagination.\nMajors build an intellectual foundation that combines broad,\ninterdisciplinary coursework and in-depth focus on a particular sub-\nﬁeld. The core courses expose students to the diversity of urban\nstudies as a ﬁeld, while the methods and Junior Seminar requirements\nintroduce them to the challenge of doing original research. This\nprepares them for their independent senior thesis project, undertaken\nover the entirety of their ﬁnal year. We encourage our majors to use\nNew York City as a laboratory, and many courses draw on the vast\nresources of the city and include an off-campus experience.\nStudent Learning Outcomes\nHaving successfully completed the major in Urban Studies, the student\nwill be able to:\n• Describe and explain urban phenomena and relations from multiple\ntheoretical and methodological perspectives.\n• Identify and analyze diverse urban issues and problems, including\ntheir complex causes and the systems that frame their potential\nresolution.\n• Evaluate approaches to collecting and analyzing diverse empirical\ndata about cities.\n• Design and conduct research on a particular urban issue or\nproblem, including developing and defending a research question,\nconducting original research, considering its risks to subjects,\nanalyzing data using recognized techniques, and interpreting\nresults.\n• Develop an extensive, clear, and carefully argued piece of writing.\nStudent Advising\nAdvising Resources\n• Prospective Columbia College majors should consult with Amy\nChazkel, Bernard Hirschhorn Associate Professor of Urban Studies\n• Prospective General Studies majors should consult with Aaron\nPassell, Associate Director of Urban Studies.\n• Please send email to urbanstudies@barnard.edu to subscribe to\nthe Urban Studies listserv.  \n• Urban Studies hosts Program Planning meetings in the Fall and\nSpring semesters and an Open House for prospective and current\nmajors.  Scheduling information for these events is disseminated\nvia the listserv.", "source": "pdfs/barnard 2024-2025.pdf"}

The course will focus on key concepts\nin planning history, theory, and practice, including the various conflicts\nand dilemmas planners face, stakeholders involved in urban planning,\nand the tools and methods that planners use to address challenges\nin the built environment. The core questions that this class will return\nto throughout the semester are: How does planning take place, and\nwhose interest(s) does planning serve? How does planning (re)produce\nsocial inequities? Planning is often framed as a technical exercise\nto rationalize the built environment and create more “livable” cities.\nHowever, planning is not value-neutral. As we will examine throughout\nthe course of the semester, power relations fundamentally shape the\nplanning profession, and planning decisions have contributed to racial,\neconomic, and gender inequalities and spatial segregation in cities\nthroughout the United States. We will also explore debates about how\nto encourage more inclusive cities and engage in more ethical planning\npractice. The course is divided into six sections. In Part I, we will\nexplore foundational concepts in urban planning, such as how previous\nscholars have deﬁned urban planning and urban space. In Part II, we\nwill explore the historical context in which the planning profession\nemerged and key moments in planning history. In Part III, we will\nexamine normative models of planning, or how the planning profession\nconceives of itself. In Part IV, we will learn about the different technical\ntools that planners use to regulate urban development and key debates\nsurrounding these tools. In Part V, we will interrogate the role of the\nplanner, the role of power relations in planning, and how planning\ndecisions have resulted in racial, class, and gender exclusion in the\nbuilt environment.

We\nwill combine close readings of ethnographies with ﬁeld-based inquiry,\nincluding our own studies of urban public space. Through both our\nreadings and our ﬁeld exercises, we will focus on the methods at\nthe heart of ethnography: observation and participant-observation.\nAs we read other scholars’ work, we will ask how the author uses\nethnographic tools to explore issues that are suitable for intensive\nﬁeldwork. We will assess which kinds of research problems and\ntheoretical perspectives are a good ﬁt with ethnography and the roles\nthat ethnography can play in transdisciplinary research projects.

In fact, schools have become\nmore segregated over the past 30 years, even as the country becomes\nincreasingly multiracial. In this class, we will use public schools as an\nexample to examine the role race plays in shaping urban spaces and\ninstitutions. We will begin by unpacking the concept of racialization, or\nthe process by which a person, place, phenomenon, or characteristic\nbecomes associated with a certain race. Then, we will explore the\nfollowing questions: What are the connections between city schools\nand their local contexts? What does it mean to be a “neighborhood\nschool”? How do changes in neighborhoods change schools? We will\nuse ethnographies, narrative non-ﬁction, and educational research to\nexplore these questions from a variety of perspectives.

While neighborhood can be interpreted as a spatial,\nsocial, political, racial, ethnic, or even, economic unit; community\noften refers to the group of stakeholders (i.e. residents, workers,\ninvestors) whose interests directly align with the conditions of their\nenvironment. Community development is “a process where these\ncommunity members come together to take collective action and\ngenerate solutions to common problems” that result from the changing\ncontexts in their neighborhoods. Using a variety of theories and\napproaches, residents organize themselves or work with community\ndevelopment practitioners on the ground to obtain safe, affordable\nhousing, improve the public realm, build wealth, get heard politically,\ndevelop human capital, and connect to metropolitan labor and housing\nmarkets. To address the ever-changing contexts of neighborhoods,\ncommunity development organizations are taking on new roles and\nadapting (in various cases) to larger forces within the city, region\nand nation such as disinvestment, reinvestment, increased cultural\ndiversity, an uncertain macroeconomic environment, and changes in\nfederal policy. For more than a century, city-dwellers—and especially\nNew Yorkers—have been tackling these challenges. This course will\nexamine both historic and contemporary community building and\ndevelopment efforts, paying special attention to approaches which\nwere shaped by New York City. This urban center, often described as a\n“city of neighborhoods,” has long been a seedbed for community-based\nproblem-solving inventions. The course will focus on the theories\n(why?), tools (how?), and actors (who?) within the ﬁeld of community\ndevelopment practice and is organized around important sectors\n(housing, econom\nFall 2024: URBS UN3450\nCourse\nNumber\nSection/Call\nNumber\nTimes/Location Instructor Points Enrollment\nURBS 3450 001/00337 M W 2:40pm - 3:55pm \n203 Diana Center\nNoah Allison 3.00 20/30", "source": "pdfs/barnard 2024-2025.pdf"}

The concept of environmental\njustice has risen in prominence in the language of environmental\nactivism, politics, and policymaking. Informed by critical studies of\nthe environment, we will address the broad question of why, for some,\nthe environment is representational of a healthy lifestyle and source\nof prosperity, while for others it is a source of risk and harm. Our\ncourse of study invites students to critically analyze environmental\njustice case studies and to develop an understanding of the complex\nrelationships among urban populations and the social, political, and\neconomic processes that lead to environmental inequality. We will\nalso explore how racism is foundational to environmental exploitation\nand consider why global struggles for racial justice are crucial for\nprotecting both people and the earth. We will pay particular attention to\nhow environmental health inequalities are linked to race, class, gender,\nand nation. Drawing from academic texts, ﬁlms, and photo essays we\nwill explore how urban planning and economic development policies\ncreate environmental inequalities in the US and globally\nSpring 2025: URBS UN3451\nCourse\nNumber\nSection/Call\nNumber\nTimes/Location Instructor Points Enrollment\nURBS 3451 001/00780 T Th 6:10pm - 7:25pm \n302 Barnard Hall\nMaricarmen\nHernandez\n3.00 20/30\nURBS UN3452 HOUSING POLICY IN THE UNITED STATES. 4.00 points.\nHow should we deﬁne housing? As a concept, housing is both simple\nand complex. As a physical concept, housing provides shelter, and\nit is durable and visible. Yet, housing is more than just its physical\ncomponents. As a social concept, housing is a clear insignia of\nsocial status and can be an investment vehicle to accumulate\nand hoard wealth. Additionally, housing (and housing policy) both\nampliﬁes and reinforces larger patterns of racial and economic bias\nwitnessed in wider society. This course examines the institutional,\neconomic, regulatory, and political factors that affect the production,\nsubsidization, and siting of housing in the United States. We will trace\nthe varied policy approaches that local, state, and federal governments\nhave leveraged to deliver affordable housing over time. Throughout\nthe course, we will pay particular attention to how U.S. housing policy\nhistorically is built on a segregationist ideology, often linking the\npresence of non-white and low-income households with neighborhood\ninstability and as a threat to stable property values. We will also\nexplore the various approaches that the public sector has pursued\nto attempt to undo the racially segregated housing market of its own\nmaking. The course is divided into three sections. Part I reviews how\nprevious scholars have deﬁned housing, provides a brief introduction\nto housing policy history, and introduces the basics of supply and\ndemand in housing markets and housing ﬁnance. Part II examines\nvarious approaches to provide affordable housing at the federal, state,\nand local level and how these approaches have evolved over time. Part\nIII examines contemporary housing policy debates. Since this class\nis an upper-level seminar, students should expect to read about 150\npages of reading per week and to listen to a podcast or watch a select\nmovie on speciﬁc weeks. Students will be expected to complete all of\nthe assigned readings before class.

While we will focus primarily on the past 30 to 40\nyears in New York City, we will consider the history of homelessness\nand housing in the United States since the Great Depression. Major\nthemes will include criminalization, origin myths, and representations\nof people who are experiencing homelessness. Key questions will\ninclude: In what ways is the current geography of homelessness the\nresult of historical patterns of racism and discrimination? How does\nstudying homelessness provide insight into the ways urban spaces\nare made? Why have shelters become the primary public response\nto homelessness in New York? How are race and gender central to\nthe project of building a shelter infrastructure in New York? How are\nshelters experienced by those living in them?

The\nspeed and scale of this transformation have produced emergent\nnew lifeways, settlement patterns, and land uses that increasingly\nblur the distinction between urban and rural areas. At the same\ntime, Chinese society is still characterized by rigid, administrative\ndivisions between the nation’s urban and rural sectors, with profound\nconsequences for people’s lives and livelihoods. The course therefore\nexamines the intersection between the rapid transformation of\nChina’s built environment and the glacial transformation of its\nadministrative categories. We will take an interdisciplinary approach\nto this investigation, using perspectives from architecture, history,\ngeography, political science, anthropology, urban planning, and cultural\nstudies, among other disciplines.\nThe course is divided into two parts: Over the ﬁrst ﬁve weeks, we will\nconsider the historical context of China’s urbanization and its urban-\nrural relations, including the imperial, colonial, and socialist periods, as\nwell as the current period of reform. In the remainder of the semester,\nwe will turn our focus to contemporary processes of urbanization, with\na particular emphasis on the complex interrelationship between urban\nand rural China.

But the distribution of such inequality is not inevitable.\nUrbanization is a product of the collective decisions we make (or\nchoose not to make) in response to the shared challenges we face in\nour cities. And, thus, the patterns of urbanization can be changed. This\nis the task of urban planning and the starting point for this advanced\nseminar, which asks how we can reshape our cities to be more just\n—to alleviate inequality rather than compound it. In embarking on\nthis effort, we face numerous “wicked” problems without clear-cut\nsolutions. The approaches one takes in addressing urban inequality\nare therefore fundamentally normative—they are shaped by one’s place\nin the world and one’s view of it. The central challenge in addressing\ninequality is thus establishing a basis for collective action amongst\ndiverse actors with differing—and sometimes conflicting—values\nand views. In other words, planning the just city a matter of both\nempathy and debate. In this course, we will endeavor to develop\ninformed positions that can help us engage with others as a basis\nfor taking collective action. The course is organized into four 3-week\nmodules, each of which addresses a dimension of the just city: equity,\ndemocracy, diversity, and sustainability. In the ﬁrst week of each\nmodule, we will discuss how the issue has been understood in history\nand theory (with an emphasis on tradeoffs between different priorities\nand values); in the second week, we will apply this discussion to a\nglobal case study prepared and presented by a team of students; and\nin the third week, we will hold an in-class debate to determine what\nshould be done.

First,\nwe study the precolonial origins of American urban systems, focusing\nespecially on Mesoamerica and the Andes, and exploring questions of\nurban continuity, disruption and change, and the forms of indigenous\ncities. Second, we study various patterns of city foundations and\ncity types across the Americas, examining Spanish, Portuguese,\nBritish, Dutch and French colonial urban systems. Third, we focus on\nthe cities more closely by looking at key issues such as urban form,\nbuilt environment, social structure. Speciﬁc themes include a critical\nanalysis of the Spanish colonial grid, the baroque city, and 18th-century\nurban reforms, as well as race and class, urban slavery, and urban\ndisease environments.\nSpring 2025: HIST UN2689\nCourse\nNumber\nSection/Call\nNumber\nTimes/Location Instructor Points Enrollment\nHIST 2689 001/00150 T Th 10:10am - 11:25am \n405 Milbank Hall\nCaterina\nPizzigoni,\nGergely Baics\n4.00 34/70\nHIST 2689 AU1/20574 T Th 10:10am - 11:25am \nOthr Other\nCaterina\nPizzigoni,\nGergely Baics\n4.00 6/6\nHIST UN3277 History of Urban Crime and Policing in Latin America in\nGlobal Perspective. 4 points.\nThis seminar will examine the social construction of criminality and\nthe institutions that developed to impose and enforce the criminal\nlaw as reflections of Latin American society throughout the region’s\nhistory, with a particular emphasis on the rise of police forces as\nthe principal means of day-to-day urban governance. Topics include\npolicing and urban slavery; policing the urban “underworld”; the\nchanging cultural importance of police in urban popular culture; the\ngrowth of scientiﬁc policing methods, along with modern criminology\nand eugenics; policing and the enforcement of gender norms in\nurban public spaces; the role of urban policing in the rise of military\ngovernments in the twentieth century; organized crime; transitional\njustice and the contemporary question of the rule of law; and the\ntransnational movement of ideas about and innovations in policing\npractice. In our readings and class discussions over the course of the\nsemester, we will trace how professionalized, modern police forces\ntook shape in cities across the region over time. This course actually\nbegins, however, in the colonial period before there was anything that\nwe would recognize as a modern, uniformed, state-run police force. We\nwill thus have a broad perspective from which to analyze critically the\nrole of police in the development of Latin American urban societies—in\nother words, to see the police in the contemporary era as contingent on\ncomplex historical processes, which we will seek to understand.\nHIST GU4012 HISTORY OF THE CITY IN LATIN AMERICA. 4.00 points.\nThis course covers the historical development of cities in Latin\nAmerica.

We will explore gender in relation to the multifaceted\ndynamic processes unfolding in North Africa in the aftermath of\nearlier political fluxes, as well as today’s instabilities and unrest\nand tomorrow’s politics. Materiality and non-discursive forces, what\ncan be called affective politics, impact our sense of belonging and\ndesire for comfort in times of chaos, religious and political instability.\nSpeciﬁcally we will focus on forces of affect and the material aspects\nof its public manifestation—the materiality of affect—through tangible\nmanifestations of affects of passion: hate and love: two opposed but\ninterlinked “emotions of revolution”, as well as their sibling, fear. The\nsame material experiences can produce materialized emotions such\nas love or hate depending on speciﬁc political and social positioning\nwithin the larger polity. Passion is at once a phenomenological state\nand an extremely fluid currency of social, political and economic\ntransaction.

Among the key questions we will consider are the following:\nWhat is natural about the body? How are distinctions made between\npresumptively normal and pathological bodies, and between psychic\nand somatic experiences?  How do historical and political-economic\nforces shape the perception and meaning of bodily difference?\nAnd most crucially: how do bodies that are multiply constituted by\ncompeting logics of gender, race, nation, and ability offer up resistance\nto these and other categorizations?\nSpring 2025: WMST GU4325\nCourse\nNumber\nSection/Call\nNumber\nTimes/Location Instructor Points Enrollment\nWMST 4325 001/00035 F 1:10pm - 3:00pm \n119 Milstein Center\nMargot Kotler 4 12/20", "source": "pdfs/barnard 2024-2025.pdf"}

We will read some primary texts\nin gender theory, and in the study of sexuality, desire, and embodiment.\nThis course also provides an introduction to the interdisciplinary\nexamination of human sexual and erotic desires, orientations, and\nidentities. We will study how desires are constructed, how they vary\nand remain the same in different places and times, and how they\ninteract with other social and cultural phenomena such as government,\nfamily, popular culture, scientiﬁc inquiry, and, especially, race and class.\nWMST UN3200 QUEER THEORY. 4.00 points.\nThis class will ask you to read a set of novels, theoretical essays and\nsocial science studies in order to think deeply about sexuality, identity,\ndesire, race, objects, relationality, being, knowing and becoming. We\nwill consider sexuality, desire and gender not as a discrete set of bodily\narticulations, nor as natural expressions of coherent identities so much\nas part off the formulation of self that Avery Gordon names “complex\npersonhood.” Beginning with a recent ﬁlm from the UK that rereads\nqueerness back through a history or labor and ending with a recent\nﬁlm made entirely on the iPhone and that stages queerness as part of\nan alternative articulation of Hollywood, we will explore new and old\ntheories of queer desire.\nThrough the readings, discussions, and assignments, you will develop\ncritical analytical skills to consider social change movements with\nparticular attention to how sex, gender, race, class, sexuality, sexual\norientation, and other systems of power shape people’s everyday\nlives. We will trace the intersection of histories of labor, medicine,\nrepresentation and activism and we will ask difﬁcult questions about\nassimilation, mainstreaming, globalization and pink capitalism.\nWMST UN3225 TRANSGENDER STUDIES - THEMES AND TOPICS. 3.00\npoints.\nThis course introduces the interdisciplinary ﬁeld of transgender\nstudies. While we will read about gender variable bodies within a long\nhistorical arc, the categories of both “transsexual” and \"transgender\"\nare recent social constructions. How did the many different forms\nof gender variance resolve into these singular forms and what has\nbeen lost in the medical and legal narrowing of gender variance to\nonly these forms? Can we make any connections between witches\nin the 17th century (often accused on the grounds of cross-gender\nidentiﬁcation), mollies and dandies in the 19th century (often marked\nas effeminate), inverts in the late 19th and early 20th century and\nlater constructions that assemble under the banner of “trans*”?\nMany academic disciplines-- including anthropology, history, gender\nstudies, literary studies, and gay and lesbian/queer studies--have\nstudied transgender identities, bodies and communities, but only\nvery recently has the ﬁeld become institutionalized in the academy\nas a discipline \"Transgender Studies.\" In this course we examine the\nongoing development of the concept of transgender as it is situated\nacross social, cultural, historical, medical, and political contexts. Along\nthe way, we will try to answer some fundamental questions: when\ndid trans* emerge as a distinct social formation? What might be the\ndifferences between the understanding of gender variance in the\nsecond half of the 20th century and formulations of the phenomena of\ncross-dressing and passing and transvestism in earlier periods? Is the\nterm \"transgender\" applicable to non-Western and previously occurring\nembodiments and practices?", "source": "pdfs/barnard 2024-2025.pdf"}

Starting from the premise that\ngender is crucial to explaining what happens in national revolutionary\nwars, postcolonial conflicts and civil wars, peacekeeping and\nhumanitarian interventions, and the social and personal aspects when\nwars come to an end; this course considers a transnational feminist\nanalysis to reflect on the relationship between gender and militarism. It\npulls together literature from different disciplinary ﬁelds to explore the\ngendered dimensions of wars of national liberation, armed conflicts,\nwartime gender based/sexual violence, politics of victimhood, anti-\nwar activism, resistance and agency.

Both VAW and GBV regularly\ngarner international media attention and occupy a growing place in\ninternational law and global governance. Since 2000 alone there have\nbeen more than 25 UN protocols, instruments and conventions directed\nat its eradication or mitigation.  By embedding gendered violence in a\ncomplex matrix international norms, legal sanctions, and humanitarian\naid, the anti-VAW movement has been able to achieve a powerful\ninternational “common sense” for deﬁning, measuring, and attending\nto violence against women in developing countries, particularly during\nconflict and post-conflict situations. When invoked in the halls of\nthe United Nations and used to shape international policy, the terms\nviolence against women (VAW) and gender-based violence (GBV) are\noften assumed to have stable meanings; yet they do not.  What do\ndifferent parties mean when they talk of violence against women or of\ngender-based violence?  What is left out when the problem is framed\nin particular ways, and whose interests are served by such framings?\n  Religion, culture, and ethnicity are often linked to gendered violence\nwith entire groups pathologized. Women in conflict situations are\nabstracted from their local contexts while the conflicts themselves\nare insistently localized. The deﬁnition of VAW or GBV is narrowed to\nattacks on bodily integrity, with economic, political and structural forms\nof violence increasingly excluded from the frames.\nThis course will explore transnational feminist debates about gender-\nbased violence and examine the critical concepts being developed\nwithin the scholarly literature to question this “common sense.” What\nare the elisions and exclusions in many common-sense understandings\nof these terms? Can we deepen the ways in which we engage with the\nmanifestations and causes of such violence?\nWe will proceed through close readings of the texts of the key feminist\nthinkers, researchers, and activists who are contributing to the\ncritical analysis of the dynamics and history of this international\nagenda. We pay special attention to place-based research on the\napplicability and deployment of particular approaches to gender-\nbased violence as found in human rights work, humanitarianism,\nphilanthrocapitalism, and the proliferating organizations, governmental\nand nongovernmental, around the world that promote girls’ and\nwomen’s rights and freedom from violence.

We begin with a rapid\nimmersion in social scientiﬁc approaches to thinking about gender in\nrelation to health, and then examine diverse areas in which gendered\nrelations of power – primarily between men and women, but also\nbetween cis- and queer individuals – shape health behaviors and\nhealth outcomes. We engage with multiple examples of how gendered\nsocial processes, in combination with other dimensions of social\nstratiﬁcation, shape health at the population level. The overarching\ngoal of this class is to provide a context for reading, discussion, and\ncritical analysis to help students learn to think about gender – and,\nby extension, about any form of social stratiﬁcation – as a driver of\npatterns in population health.

By examining the sonic, texted, and\nvisual components of popular music in relation to gender, sexuality,\nthe body, race, ethnicity, economics, and nation, students will develop\na critical vocabulary for discussing and analyzing the effects and\nmeanings of popular music as ﬁltered by twenty-ﬁrst century listeners.\nThrough close listening, discussion of assigned readings and pieces,\nand analytical writing on recorded and live performances, the course\nwill encourage students to examine a wide repertory of popular music\nby using a variety of intersectional analytical “sieves,” reﬁning and\nenriching their experience of popular music as critically astute listeners\nand writers. This course is designed for students who are interested\nin sharpening their listening practices but does not assume previous\nformal study of music. The course 1) introduces the fundamental\nof music through exercises in listening and writing, 2) focuses on a\nselection of current literature on listening, theoretical approaches to\nmusic analysis, and feminist/queer criticism; 3) attunes students to the\nvarious indices of musical structure (melody, form, harmony, rhythm\n& meter, words, flow & groove, performance); 4) brings together these\nparts of music into feminist/queer, alternative hearings of speciﬁc\nworks.

In this  course, we seek to examine ways in which\nsex is both social and political. That is to say, sexuality has different\nmeanings in different contexts, and it has different effects in terms of\npower relations within the social order. To this end, we will examine\nhow sexuality has been socially constructed, paying careful attention\nto the ways these ideas relate to other social forces such as gender,\nrace, and class. We begin with a historical examination as to how\nsexuality has been deﬁned as a natural component of self by\nearly sexologists and eugenicists, paying careful attention to their\ncontemporary legacies. We continue this historical overview through an\nexamination of early scholars who increasingly argued that sexuality\nhas a social basis, culminating in the theoretical analyses of Foucault.\nThe ﬁrst part of this course thus seeks to historically situate and\ndenaturalize some of the basic concepts we tend to take for granted,\nincluding that of “sexuality” itself. In the second part of the course,\nwe will consider the state of sexual politics within the contemporary\nUnited States, focusing upon key arenas of political struggle including\nsex education, prostitution, and homosexuality.\nWMST V3137 Feminist Sexual Politics in Historical Perspective. 4\npoints.\nNot offered during 2023-2024 academic year.\nWhy, and in what ways, has sex been a central issue for feminism\nthroughout its history?  How have feminist attitudes towards sex\nchanged over time, and how did attitudes vary amongst feminists\nthemselves? What connections did feminists make between sexual\nreform, women’s rights, and broader social, political, and economic\nchange?  And what are the legacies of  past feminist sexual politics for\nthe present day? This course addresses these questions by exploring\nthe history of feminist sexual politics in Europe over the course of the\n“long nineteenth century,” that is, between the years 1789 and 1918,\nand will focus on developments in Britain, France, and Germany.  From\nthe French Revolution to the achievement of women’s suffrage, we\nwill examine feminists’ writings on and activism surrounding sex and\nsexuality to understand how deﬁnitions of “sex,” “feminism,” and “sexual\npolitics” changed over time, and how issues of class and race shaped\nfeminist sexual politics.  We will also analyze contradictions, tensions\nand continuities within diverse feminist approaches to sexuality, and\nassess similarities and differences amongst feminists from different\nnational backgrounds.  Furthermore, by adopting a focus on feminism\nand sexuality, this course offers a unique lens on the major “world\nhistorical” events of modern European history.\nWMST V3140 Race and Sexuality: Black Queers. 4 points.\nSeminar.Not offered during 2023-2024 academic year.\nPrerequisites: the instructor's permission.

We will study contemporary sound art\nthat variously speaks to inequalities in canon-formation, participates\nin human rights movements of the late 20th and 21st centuries,\nand suggests feminist and queer readings of everyday sonic praxis.\nReadings in feminist theory, critical theory, art history, musicology, and\nmedia studies will guide in-class discussion of artworks accessed\nthrough on-line archives and New York-based installations. We will also\nreview artist statements, exhibition catalogues, conference programs,\non-line media, and journalistic articles. The seminar will address the\nfollowing questions: What role do sound-based creative practices\nplay in re-/de-/forming raced, gendered, and sexual subjects? What is\nthe place of activism in sound-based arts engaged with feminist and\nqueer politics? Can sound be feminist, queer, Afrofuturist? How should\ntheorists of race, gender, and sexuality address sound in and out of the\narts?", "source": "pdfs/barnard 2024-2025.pdf"}

How do gender\nand sexuality circulate across national, political, and technological\nborders in the contemporary era of neoliberal globalization? How has\nfeminism itself become part of these increasingly complex cultural\ncirculations, to women’s beneﬁt as well as detriment? In addition\nto linking together what Chandra Mohanty has described as the\n“One Third” and “Two Thirds” worlds, this discussionbased seminar\nseeks to reconnect the disparately gendered intimate and global\nspheres, situating the feminized “private” domains of love, sex, and\ncaring within ﬁelds of action such as geopolitics and global political\neconomy.  How do formations of gender and sexuality shift when\nintimate relations are transnationalized? Does the globalization of\nintimacy exacerbate inequalities of gender, race, class, and nation, or\nmight it also and simultaneously create unexpected opportunities to\nalleviate these? Under what circumstances does feminism itself get\nintertwined in circuits of gendered power? In the ﬁrst part of this class,\nwe will carefully examine issues of gender, sexuality, and development.\nIn the latter, we turn increasingly toward issues of emotion and\ntransnational intimate exchange and emotional labor while situating\nthese encounters within the economic context we discussed in the ﬁrst\nsection.\nWMST W3514 Historical Approaches to Feminist Questions. 4 points.\nThis class is an introduction to the debates on women that played\na dominant role in both the philosophical and literary traditions of\nthe European/Atlantic world from the classical period through the\nseventeenth-century. Beginning with the works of ancient political\ntheory that actively debated women’s political, social, and ethical\nposition in society (chiefly Aristotle, Plato, and Plutarch), the course\nwill address the pan-European books of “Good Women” that served as\nexemplary case studies, the querelle des femmes (or debate on women)\nthat dominated political and humanist discourse of the sixteenth and\nseventeenth centuries, and the crucial importance of the political\nanalogies between the household and the state and the marital and\nsocial contracts in the premodern world (and, indeed, in our own). \nWe will study works from ancient Greece and Rome and medieval and\nearly modern Italy, Spain, France, England, Ethiopia and Mexico, and\ntopics ranging from domestic violence and political resistance theory\nto transvestitism and lesbianism.\nWMST W3625 Memoir and Embodiment. 4 points.\nNot offered during 2023-2024 academic year.\nRecent decades have witnessed a flood of life writing about the\nbody, much of it by women and much of it about experiences of\nillness and disability.  This development represents a signiﬁcant\nchange, as autobiography has historically been reserved for the most\naccomplished and able-bodied among us.  Our course will study the\nrise of what G’ Thomas Couser calls “the some body memoir,” asking\nhow it revises traditional autobiography as it attempts to carve out\nliterary space for voices and bodies that have not historically been\nrepresented in public.  We will consider how these new memoirs talk\nback to doctors and other health care professionals who medicalize\nthe disabled body, as well as social environments that stigmatize\nand exclude the ill and disabled.  We will also ask how race and\ngender inform stories of illness and disability, as well as investigating\ndifferences between physical and mental illness and/or disability.  \nEach week we will read one memoir, paired with other writings meant\nto prompt discuss and critical examination.  In addition to more\ntraditional academic writing, students will also have opportunities to\nexperiment with their own life writing.\nWMST W3880 History of Sex in the 'West,' 1789-1967. 4 points.\nThis course explores the importance of sexuality to modern histories\nof North America and Western Europe, with particular emphasis on\nthe U.S. and U.K., and secondarily Canada, Germany and France.  We\nwill examine changing sexual cultures and their relationship to new\ngender norms from the late seventeenth century through the mid\ntwentieth century.  The emergence and ascendance of concepts of\ngender, the self, heterosexuality and homosexuality will be examined\nthrough political, intellectual, cultural, and social history.  The course\nbegins when new attitudes about individual privacy, equality, and\nfreedom ﬁrst took hold in ways that helped to deﬁne the “West” and\n“modern” attitudes about gender and sex.  We will track the continual\nrevisions to, and contestations over, this ﬁrst sexual revolution through\nthe 1960s, when celebrations and concerns about sexual liberation,\nhedonism, and the “decline of virtue” came to occupy the center of\ncultural debates.  We will examine the ways in which the study of\nsexuality intersects with, and offers opportunities to re-think, other\nmajor topics in the histories of the ‘West,’ including the role of state\nregulation, and ideas about reproduction, racial categories, violence,\npleasure and love.\nWMST W3890 From Exclusion to Inclusion? Sexuality and Citizenship\nin American Politics. 4 points.\nFor much of the 20th century, the American political system excluded\nlesbians and gay men from full citizenship.  This course seeks to\nunderstand the political and social forces shaping the transformation\nof these sex nonconformists from a pariah group into a viable social\nmovement and eventually into a powerful constituency within the\nDemocratic Party.  Special emphasis will be placed on the state’s role\nin deﬁning lesbian and gay identities, the ways in which gender and\nracial diversity have shaped the LGB movement, and the role that\npartisan electoral strategies played in ushering sexuality to the center\nof American political conflict.", "source": "pdfs/barnard 2024-2025.pdf"}

What characterized the corporeality of the medieval hero? How\ndid writers depict themselves and the objects of their desire? When\ngenitalia “speak for themselves,” as in some the medieval fabliaux we\nwill read, what do they say and whose desire do they express? Which\nbodies are clearly gendered and why?

We explore how feminist\nanalyses may reorient how we think about the past. We also ask how\nhistorical perspectives can bring the contingent and contextual nature\nof ideas about gender and sexuality into relief. We will consult both\nprimary and secondary historical sources as well as key theoretical\ntexts on the politics of women’s history and the history of sexuality in\nintersection with other forms of identity and inequality.\nWMST W3922 The Jazz Age: ﬁctional representations of Jewish-\nAmerican and African-America women in the city. 4 points.\nNot offered during 2023-2024 academic year.\nThe “Roaring 20s” evokes images of jazz, the flapper, cabarets, Harlem,\nthe bohemian life of Greenwich Village, and a time of greater freedoms\nfor women in the US.  All of these images are associated with urban\nlife and have clear racial, class, gender, and sexual connotations. In\nthis course, we will be examining classic Jazz-Age Jewish-American\nand African-American ﬁction that presents \"New Woman\" female\nprotagonists.   We will be tracing the differences between the\nrepresentation of the Jewish-American \"New Woman\" and the \"New\nNegro Woman,\" while discussing what these differences might signify\nwith respect to the positionality of Jewish and black women in the US.\nWMST W3940 Queer Theories and Histories. 4 points.\nThis course examines a genealogy of contemporary debates in\nqueer theory beginning with feminist debates on sexuality and power\nin the 1970s and moving through critical race theory, the rise of\nantinormativity, affect theory, and posthumanism.

The course begins with an overview of sociological\nand feminist scholarship on the family. We then examine how\ndevelopments stemming from genetic science have spurred the\nemergence of new reproductive technologies over the last few decades\nand, in turn, novel forms of procreation and afﬁliation. To what extent\ndo assisted reproduction practices, such as in vitro fertilization,\nprenatal diagnosis, and surrogacy, offer novel ways for constituting\nand conceptualizing the family? Which constituencies beneﬁt from\nthese possibilities, which enable them, and which are constrained by\nthem? To what extent do clinical and reproductive genetics privilege\nbiological relatedness and, therefore, traditional gender ideologies?\nHow is the family now simultaneously case as a source of (health) risk,\na necessary resource for optimal (healthy) living, and a volitional social\nform? We will take up these questions against the backdrop of forms of\nkin-keeping sociality (family reunions, genealogy, etc.), on the one hand,\nand, on the other hand, \"biosociality\" and biological afﬁnity.

As some social\nthinkers note, both sides of the term \"human rights\" are ripe for\ncritical rethinking:  the universality implied by the \"human\" - and by\nextension  \"women\" or \"sexuality\" - and the liberalism that makes\n\"rights\" the language of choice today in the search for justice.\nAlthough feminists and others working in multicultural settings or\nthe international arena often invoke notions of culture, especially in\nframing dilemmas of intervention in terms of a clash between cultures\nand universal rights, it is important ﬁrst to have the theoretical tools to\ndevelop adequate understandings of the dynamics of culture and the\nrelationship between culture, social systems, and historical change.  \nThis course will explore what  theories of culture and ethnographies of\n particular communities, as well as other forms of regional knowledges,\nincluding the historical, can contribute to our thinking about the\nrelationship between gender rights and culture. While appreciating the\ninstrumental power and emancipatory possibilities of rights discourses\nin the sphere of gender and sexuality, whether around inequality or\nviolence, it is also crucial to reflect on the recent challenges to this\nparadigm, especially those that question concepts of culture.\nWMST W4320 Queer Theories and Histories. 4 points.\nEnrollment limited to 20.Not offered during 2023-2024 academic year.\nThe course will cover a range of (mostly U.S. and mostly 20th-Century)\nmaterials that thematize gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender experience\nand identity.
