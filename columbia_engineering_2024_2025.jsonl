{"page_index": 6, "page_content": "22 COLUMBIA ENGINEERING–YESTERDAY AND TODAY\nA COLONIAL CHARTER\nSince its founding in 1754, as King’s \nCollege, Columbia University has always \nbeen an institution both of and for the \nCity of New Y ork. And it has always \nbeen an institution of and for engineers. \nIn its original charter, the College stated \nthat it would teach, among other things, \n“the arts of Number and Measuring, \nof Surveying and Navigation, . . . the \nknowledge of . . . Meteors, Stones, \nMines and Minerals, Plants and Animals, \nand everything useful for the Comfort, \nthe Convenience and Elegance of Life.”\nTHE GILDED AGE\nAs the city grew, so did the School. \nKing’s College was rechartered as \nColumbia College in 1784 and relocated \nfrom the Wall Street area to what is \nnow Midtown in 1857. Students began \nentering the new School of Mines in \n1864. Trained in mining, mineralogy, \nand engineering, Columbia graduates \ncontinued to make their mark both at \nhome and abroad.\nWorking around the globe, William \nBarclay Parsons, Class of 1882, was an \nengineer on the Chinese railway and \nthe Cape Cod and Panama Canals. \nMost important for New Y ork, he was \nchief engineer of the city’s first subway. \nOpened in 1904, the subway’s electric \ncars took passengers from City Hall \nto Brooklyn, the Bronx, and the newly \nrenamed and relocated Columbia \nUniversity in Morningside Heights.\nA MODERN SCHOOL  \nFOR MODERN TIMES\nThe School of Mines became the \nSchool of Mines, Engineering, and \nChemistry in 1896, and its professors \nincluded Michael Idvorsky Pupin, a \ngraduate of the Columbia College Class \nof 1883. As a professor at Columbia, \nPupin did pioneering work in carrier-\nwave detection and current analysis, \nwith important applications in radio \nbroadcasting. He is perhaps most \nfamous for having invented the “Pupin \ncoil,” which extended the range of long-\ndistance telephones.\nAn early student of Pupin’s was \nIrving Langmuir. Langmuir, Class of 1903, \nenjoyed a long career at the General \nElectric research laboratory. There he \ninvented a gas-filled tungsten lamp, \ncontributed to the development of \nthe radio vacuum tube, and extended \nGilbert Lewis's work on electron \nbonding and atomic structure. His \nresearch in monolayering and surface \nchemistry led to a Nobel Prize in \nChemistry in 1932.\nBut early work on radio vacuum \ntubes was not restricted to private \nindustry. Working with Pupin, an \nengineering student named Edwin \nHoward Armstrong was conducting \nexperiments with the Audion tube \nin the basement of Philosophy Hall \nwhen he discovered how to amplify \nradio signals through regenerative \ncircuits. Armstrong, Class of 1913, was \nstationed in France during the First \nWorld War, where he invented the \nsuperheterodyne circuit to tune in \nand detect the frequencies of enemy \naircraft ignition systems. After the war, \nArmstrong improved his method of \nfrequency modulation (FM), and by \n1931, had both eliminated the static \nand improved the fidelity of radio \nbroadcasting forever. The historic \nsignificance of Armstrong’s contributions \nwas recognized by the U.S. government \nwhen the Philosophy Hall laboratory \nwas designated a National Historic \nLandmark in 2003.\nAs the United States evolved into \na major twentieth-century political \npower, the University continued to build \nonto its undergraduate curriculum the \nbroad range of influential graduate \nand professional schools that define it \ntoday. Renamed once again in 1926, \nthe School of Engineering prepared \nstudents for careers not only as \nengineers of nuclear-age technology, \nbut as leaders engaged with the far-\nreaching political implications of that \ntechnology as well.\nAfter receiving a master’s degree \nfrom the School in 1929, Admiral Hyman \nGeorge Rickover served during the \nSecond World War as head of the \nelectrical section of the Navy’s Bureau \nof Ships. A proponent of nuclear sea \npower, Rickover directed the planning \nand construction of the world’s first \nnuclear submarine, the 300-foot-long \nNautilus, launched in 1954.\nTECHNOLOGY AND BEYOND\nToday, The Fu Foundation School of \nEngineering and Applied Science, as \nit was named in 1997, continues to \nENGINEERING 2024–2025", "source": "pdfs/columbia engineering 2024-2025.pdf"}

Even Joseph \nEngelberger, Class of 1946, the father \nof modern robotics, could not have \nanticipated the revolutionary speed with \nwhich cumbersome and expensive “big \nscience” computers would shrink to the \nsize of a wallet.\nNo one could have imagined the \nexplosive growth of technology and \nits interdisciplinary impact. Columbia \nEngineering is in a unique position to \ntake advantage of the research facilities \nand talents housed at Columbia to form \nrelationships among and between other \nschools and departments within the \nUniversity. Biomedical Engineering, with \nclose ties to the Medical School, is but \none example. Interdisciplinary centers \nare the norm, with cross-disciplinary \nresearch going on in biomedical \nimaging, environmental chemistry, \nmaterials science, nanotechnology, \ndigital, and new media technologies. \nThe School and its departments \nhave links to the Departments of \nPhysics, Chemistry, Earth Science, and \nMathematics, as well as the College of \nPhysicians and Surgeons, the Graduate \nSchool of Journalism, Lamont-Doherty \nEarth Observatory, The Climate \nSchool, Teachers College, Columbia \nBusiness School, and the Graduate \nSchool of Architecture, Planning and \nPreservation. The transforming gift of \nThe Fu Foundation has catapulted the \nSchool into the forefront of collaborative \nresearch and teaching and has given \nstudents the opportunity to work with \nprize-winning academicians, including \nNobel laureates from many disciplines.\nNEW RESEARCH FRONTIERS\nColumbia’s technology transfer office, \nColumbia Technology Ventures, works \nwith faculty inventors to commercialize \nideas and brings in millions in licensing \nrevenue annually. Columbia Engineering \nfaculty have been instrumental in \ndeveloping some of the most successful \ninventions in consumer electronics, as \nwell as establishing many of the widely \naccepted global standards for storage \nand transmission of high-quality audio \nand video data. Columbia is the only \nuniversity actively participating in a \nbroad range of standards-based patent \npools, including AVC (Advanced Video \nCoding), the world standard for audio/\nvideo compression that is now one of \nthe most commonly used HD formats \nand most commonly employed in \nstreaming media; and ATSC, a standard \ndeveloped by the Advanced Television \nSystems Committee for digital television \ntransmission. It is now the U.S. standard \nfor recording and retrieval of data and \nHD audio-visual media.

Programs such as \nthe COSMOS Wireless Testbed, the \nColumbia IBM-Center for Blockchain \nand Data Transparency, the Columbia \nCenter of AI Technology, the Columbia \nElectrochemical Energy Center, and the \nCS3 Center for Smart Streetscapes are \nstrengthening interdisciplinary capacity \nand fostering an entrepreneurial \nand inventive energy within the \nSchool. Some of these programs \nand centers have helped prepare \nideas for commercialization, including \npersonalized robotics for use in physical \nrehabilitation and an implantable device \nthat acts as a minimally-invasive glucose \nsensor for diabetic patients.\nENTREPRENEURSHIP\nThroughout the academic year, the \nSchool hosts many activities and \nnetworking events to support its \nactive startup community, including \nthe Columbia Engineering Fast Pitch \nCompetition, Columbia Venture \nCompetition, Design Challenges, \nHackathons, and the Ignition Grants \nprogram, which funds ventures started \nby current students. \nEntrepreneurship remains an \nimportant central educational theme \nat Columbia Engineering. The School \noffers a range of programs and a \n15-credit, interdisciplinary minor in \nentrepreneurship, as well as a dual \ndegree program with Columbia \nBusiness School (CBS), the MBAxMS, \nwhich consists of a MBA from CBS \nand an Executive MS in Engineering \nand Applied Science from Columbia \nEngineering. The School also provides a \nfour-year entrepreneurship experience \nfor all interested Columbia Engineering \nstudents, regardless of major.\nAnd for alumni, entrepreneurial \nsupport continues. The Columbia \nStartup Lab, a coworking facility located \nin SoHo, provides subsidized space \nfor Columbia alumni entrepreneurs \nto house and nurture their fledgling \nventures. The Lab is the result of a \nunique partnership between the deans \nof Columbia College and the Schools \nof Business, Engineering, Law, and \nInternational and Public Affairs.\nA FORWARD-LOOKING TRADITION\nBut, for all its change, there is still a \ncontinuous educational thread that \nremains the same. Committed to the \neducational philosophy that a broad, \nrigorous exposure to the liberal arts \nprovides the surest chart with which \nan engineer can navigate the future, \nall undergraduates must complete a \nmodified but equally rigorous version \nof Columbia College’s celebrated \nCore Curriculum. It is these selected \ncourses in contemporary civilization in \nthe West and other global cultures that \nbest prepare a student for advanced \ncoursework; a wide range of eventual \nprofessions; and a continuing, life-long \npursuit of knowledge, understanding, \nand social perspective. It is also \nthese Core courses that most closely \ntie today’s students to the alumni of \ncenturies past. Through a shared \nexposure to the nontechnical areas, all \nColumbia Engineering students—past, \npresent, and future—gain the humanistic \ntools needed to build lives not solely as \ntechnical innovators, but as social and \npolitical ones as well.\nA COLLEGE WITHIN THE \nUNIVERSITY\nCombining the advantages of a small \ncollege with the extensive resources \nof a major research university, students \nat Columbia Engineering pursue their \nacademic interests under the guidance \nof outstanding senior faculty members \nwho teach both undergraduate and \ngraduate-level courses. Encouraged by \nthe faculty to undertake research at all \nlevels, students at the School receive \nthe kind of personal attention that only \nColumbia’s exceptionally high faculty-\nstudent ratio affords.\nTHE NEW YORK ADVANTAGE\nBesides the faculty, the single greatest \nresource for students is without doubt \nthe City of New Y ork. Within easy reach \nby walking, bus, subway, or taxi, New \nY ork’s broad range of social, cultural, \nand business communities offer an \nunparalleled opportunity for students \nto expand their horizons or deepen \ntheir understanding of almost any \nhuman endeavor imaginable. With art \nfrom small Chelsea galleries to major \nmuseums; music from Harlem jazz clubs \nto the Metropolitan Opera; theater from \nperformance art in the East Village \nto musicals on Broadway; food from \naround the world; and every sport \nimaginable, New Y ork is the cultural \ncrossroads of the world.\nNew Y ork is also a major player in \nhigh-tech research and development, \nwhere Fortune 500 companies traded \non Wall Street seek partnerships with \nhigh-tech startups in Tribeca and \nBrooklyn. As part of the research \ncommunity themselves, Columbia \nstudents have exceptional opportunities \nfor contact with industry both on and \noff campus. Senior representatives of \nthese companies often visit Columbia to \nlecture as adjunct faculty members or \nas guest speakers, and undergraduate \nand graduate students frequently \nundertake research or internships with \nthese and other companies, oftentimes \nleading to offers of full-time employment \nafter graduation.\nIn addition to its ties to private \nindustry, Columbia also has a historically \nclose relationship with the public sector \nof New Y ork, stretching back to the \neighteenth century. No other city in \nthe world offers as many impressive \nexamples of the built environment—\nthe world’s most famous collection \nof skyscrapers, long-span bridges, \nroad and railroad tunnels, and one \nof the world’s largest subway and \nwater supply systems. Involved in \nall aspects of the city’s growth and \ncapital improvements over the years, \nColumbia engineers have been \nresponsible for the design, analysis, and \nmaintenance of New Y ork’s enormous \ninfrastructure of municipal services and \ncommunications links, as well as its \ngreat buildings, bridges, tunnels, and \nmonuments.\nTHE UNIVERSITY AT LARGE\nColumbia University occupies three \nmajor campuses, as well as additional \nspecial-purpose facilities throughout \nthe area.

Study abroad allows \nengineering students to discover \nthe field through the perspective \nof engineers working in a different \nlanguage and culture, enabling them \nto learn the relationship of culture \nto science and develop the range \nof transferable skills that employers \nare seeking today. Study abroad will \nhelp students develop intellectually, \nemotionally, culturally, and socially.\nColumbia Engineering \nundergraduate students can study \nabroad for either a semester (fall, spring, \nor summer) or, exceptionally, for a full \nacademic year. Students from every \nengineering major have studied abroad, \nand most do so in the spring semester \nof their sophomore year or in their \njunior year. Although not a requirement, \nstudents are encouraged to have some \nforeign language skills in order to \nenhance their cultural competency and \ntheir overall study abroad experience.\nThe Center for Undergraduate \nGlobal Engagement will help students \nidentify the appropriate choice for \ntheir country of interest and their \nmajor. Departmental advisers and \nfaculty will help students with their \ncourse equivalencies for approved \nprograms so they can graduate on \ntime. Students can take nontechnical \nelectives overseas, or with departmental \npermission, they may choose technical \nelectives or courses in their major. \nIt is essential that students begin \nplanning as early as possible. Students \nare encouraged to meet with advisers \nin the Center for Undergraduate Global \nEngagement to review possible global \nopportunities.

In addition to the \ncourses required by their program, \nstudents must continue to satisfy \ncertain distributive requirements, \nchoosing elective courses that provide \nsufficient content in engineering \nsciences and engineering design. The \norder and distribution of the prescribed \ncoursework may be changed with the \nadviser’s approval. Specific questions \nconcerning course requirements should \nbe addressed to the appropriate \ndepartment or division.\nDouble Major\nStudents who wish to apply for a \nsecond major must consult their \nadvising dean about next steps. A \nproposal to double major must be \napproved by both departments and \nthen forwarded to the Vice Dean of \nAcademic Programs for a final decision.\nMajor courses cannot be cross-\ncounted between dual majors. Please \nconsult with an Advising Dean and the \nrespective departmental advisors to \nfind alternative courses for duplicate \nrequirements.\n3-2 students are not eligible to have \na second major because of the time \nconstraints of their program.  \nTau Beta Pi\nTau Beta Pi is the nation’s second-\noldest honor society, founded at \nLehigh University in 1885. With the \ncreed “Integrity and excellence in \nengineering,” it is the only engineering \nhonor society representing the entire \nengineering profession.

In \nan increasingly technological society, \nwhere the line between humanities \nand technology is becoming blurred, \nindividuals with a thorough grounding \nin applied sciences and engineering \nfind themselves highly sought after as \nprofessionals in practically all fields of \nendeavor.\nEngineering students interested in \npursuing graduate work in such areas \nas architecture, business, education, \njournalism, or law will find themselves \nwell prepared to meet the generally \nflexible admissions requirements \nof most professional schools. \nUndergraduate students should, \nhowever, make careful inquiry into the \nkinds of specific preparatory work that \nmay be required for admission into \nhighly specialized programs such as \nmedicine.\nPremed\nMedical, dental, and other health \nprofessional schools prefer that \nundergraduates complete a four-year \nprogram of study toward the bachelor's \ndegree. All health professional schools \nrequire prerequisite coursework, but \nthey do not prefer one type of major or \nscholarly concentration. Students with \nall types of engineering backgrounds \nare highly valued.\nIt is important to note, however, \nthat each medical school in the \nUnited States and Canada individually \ndetermines its own entrance \nrequirements, including prerequisite \ncoursework and/or competencies. \nEach medical school also sets its own \nrules regarding acceptable courses \nor course equivalents. It is therefore \nessential that students plan early and \nconfirm the premedical requirements \nfor those schools to which they intend \nto apply. The Engineering curriculum \ncovers many of the prerequisite \ncourses required by medical schools; \nhowever, in addition to completing the \nmathematics, chemistry, and physics \ncourses required by the First-Y ear/\nSophomore Program, most schools ask \nfor a full year of organic chemistry, a full \nyear of biology, a full year of English, a \nsemester of statistics, and a semester \nof biochemistry. Advanced Placement \ncredit is accepted in fulfillment of these \nrequirements by some schools but \nnot all. Students are responsible for \nmonitoring the requirements of each \nschool to which they intend to apply.\nGenerally, students with Advanced \nPlacement credit are strongly advised to \ntake further courses in the field in which \nthey have received such credit.\nIn addition to medical school \nrequirements, all medical schools \ncurrently require applicants to sit for \nthe Medical College Admissions Test \n(MCAT). The recommended preparation \nfor this exam is:\n• One year of general chemistry and \ngeneral chemistry lab\n• One year of organic chemistry and \norganic chemistry lab\n• One year of introductory biology and \nbiology lab\n• One semester of biochemistry\n• One year of general physics and  \nphysics lab\n• One semester of introductory  \npsychology\nAs you prepare for this path, you \nshould consult regularly with both \nyour assigned adviser and one of \nthe premedical advisers in the James \nH. Christine Turk Berick Center for \nStudent Advising. These individuals \nwill help to guide you in your course \nselection and planning, and introduce \nyou to extracurricular and research \nopportunities related to your interests \nin health and medicine. Preprofessional \nAdvising maintains an online list of many \ndifferent clinical volunteer and research \nopportunities across New Y ork City and \nbeyond. Exploration of the career and \nsustained interactions with patients is \nviewed by many medical schools as \nessential preparation, and therefore \nstudents are strongly encouraged to \nspend time volunteering/working in \nclinical and research environments \nbefore applying to medical school.\nStudents must apply for admission \nto health professional schools more \nthan one year in advance of the entry \ndate. Students who are interested in \ngoing directly on to health professional \nschools following graduation should \ncomplete all prerequisite courses \nrequired for the MCAT by the end of \nthe junior year. It is entirely acceptable \n(and most common) for students to \ntake time between undergraduate and \nhealth professional school and thus \ndelay application to these schools for \none or more years. Students planning \nto apply to medical or dental school \nshould be evaluated by the Premedical \nAdvisory Committee prior to application. \nA Premedical Advisory Committee \napplication is made available each year \nin December. For more information \nregarding this process and other \npremedical-related questions, please \nconsult with a premedical adviser in the \nBerick Center for Student Advising or \nperuse its website at cc-seas.columbia.\nedu/preprofessional/health.\nPrelaw\nStudents fulfilling the School of \nEngineering and Applied Science’s \ncurriculum are well prepared to apply \nto and enter professional schools of \nlaw, which generally do not require any \nspecific prelaw coursework. Schools of \nlaw encourage undergraduate students \nto complete a curriculum characterized \nby rigorous intellectual training involving \nrelational, syntactical, and abstract \nthinking. While selecting courses, keep \nin mind the need to hone your writing \nskills, your communication skills, and \nyour capacity for logical analysis.\nWhile engineering students may find \ninterests in many areas of the law, for \nintellectual property and patent law, a \nscience and technology background will \nbe greatly valued, if not essential.\nUrban Teaching: New York State ", "source": "pdfs/columbia engineering 2024-2025.pdf"}

Possible \nforms of support for tuition, fees, \nbooks, and living expenses are: \ninstitutional grants, fellowships, \nteaching and research assistantships, \non- or off-campus employment, and \nstudent loans. The Office of Student \nFinancial Planning assists students \nwith developing financing plans for \ncompleting a degree.\nColumbia University graduate \nfunds are administered by two \nseparate branches of the University, \nand the application materials \nrequired by the two branches differ. \nInstitutional grants, fellowships, and \nteaching and research assistantships \nare all departmentally-administered \nfunds. Questions regarding these \nawards should be directed to your \nacademic department. Federal \nStudent Loans (Unsubsidized and \nGraduate PLUS) and private student \nloans are administered by the Office \nof Student Financial Planning. \nQuestions about loans should be \ndirected to the financial aid office via \nemail at sfp@columbia.edu or phone \nat 212-854-7040.\nFurther information can be found at \nsfs.columbia.edu/sfp-grad-engin.\nINSTRUCTIONS FOR  \nFINANCIAL AID APPLICANTS\nDeadlines\nApply for financial aid at the same \ntime that you apply for admission. \nY our admissions application must \nbe received by the December 15 \ndeadline to be eligible for The Fu \nFoundation School of Engineering and \nApplied Science departmental funding \n(institutional grants, fellowships, and \nteaching and research assistantships). \nSpring admissions applicants will not be \nconsidered for departmental funding.\nIncoming applicants and continuing \nstudents should complete the FAFSA at \nstudentaid.gov/h/apply-for-aid/fafsa for \nfall enrollment.\nGuidelines for continuing students \nare available from departmental \nadvisers in advance of the established \ndeadline.

Funding decisions, based \nsolely on merit, and contingent upon \nmaking satisfactory academic progress, \nare made by the departments. All \napplicants for admission and continuing \nstudents maintaining satisfactory \nacademic standing will be considered \nfor departmental funds. Applicants \nshould contact their department directly \nfor information. Columbia Engineering \nprospective and continuing graduate \nstudents must complete their FAFSA in \norder to be considered for all forms of \ngraduate financing (both departmentally-\nadministered and financial aid–\nadministered funds). The application \nfor admission to Columbia Engineering \ngraduate programs is also used to \napply for departmental funding. Outside \nscholarships for which you qualify must \nbe reported to your department and the \nOffice of Student Financial Planning . \nThe School reserves the right to adjust \nyour institutional award if you hold an \noutside scholarship, fellowship, or other \noutside funding.\nInstitutional Grants\nInstitutional grants are awarded to \ngraduate students on the basis of \nacademic merit. Recipients must \nmaintain satisfactory academic standing.\nFellowships\nFellowships are financial and intellectual \nawards for academic merit that provide \nstipends to be used by fellows to further \ntheir research.

They are prepared \nfor graduate study in biomedical \nengineering and several related \nareas of engineering and the health \nsciences. Students can meet entrance \nrequirements for graduate training in \nthe various allied health professions. \nNo more than three additional courses \nare required to satisfy entrance \nrequirements for most U.S. medical \nschools.\nAll biomedical engineering \nstudents are expected to register for \nnontechnical electives, both those \nspecifically required by the School of \nEngineering and Applied Science and \nthose needed to meet the 27-point total \nof nontechnical electives required for \ngraduation.\nFirst and Second Y ears\nAs outlined in this bulletin, in the \nfirst two years, all engineering \nstudents are expected to complete a \nsequence of courses in mathematics, \nphysics, chemistry, computer science, \nengineering, modern biology, English \ncomposition, and physical education, as \nwell as nontechnical electives including \nthe humanities. For most of these \nsequences, the students may choose \nfrom two or more tracks. If there is a \nquestion regarding the acceptability \nof a course as a nontechnical elective, \nplease consult the approved listing of \ncourses beginning on page 9 or contact \nyour advising dean for clarification.\nPlease see the charts in this \nsection for a specific description of \ncourse requirements.\nFor students who are interested \nin the biomedical engineering major, \nthey must take E1201: Introduction to \nelectrical engineering. For the computer \nscience requirement, students must \ntake ENGI E1006. They must take \nthe two-semester BIOL UN2005 and \nUN2006: Introduction to Biology I & II  in \nthe second year, which gives students \na comprehensive overview of modern \nbiology from molecular to organ system \nlevels. In addition, all students must take \nAPMA E2101: Introduction to applied \nmathematics in their second year. \nThird and Fourth Y ears\nThe biomedical engineering programs \nat Columbia are based on engineering \nand biological fundamentals. This is \nemphasized in our core requirements, \nwhich cannot be waived nor substituted. \nAll students must take the two-semester \nintroduction to biomedical engineering \ncourses, BMEN E3010 and E3020: \nBiomedical engineering I & II, which \nprovide a broad yet solid foundation in \nthe biomedical engineering discipline. \nIn parallel, all students take the two-\nsemester Quantitative physiology, I and \nII sequence (BMEN E4001-E4002), which \nis taught by biomedical engineering \nfaculty and emphasizes quantitative \napplications of engineering principles in \nunderstanding biological systems and \nphenomena from molecular to organ \nsystem levels. In the fields of biomedical \nengineering, experimental techniques \nand principles are fundamental skills that \ngood biomedical engineers must master. \nBeginning in junior year, all students \ntake the two-semester sequence \nBiomedical engineering laboratory, I   \n& II (BMEN E3810, E3820). In this two-\nsemester series, students learn through \nhands-on experience the principles and \nmethods of biomedical engineering \nexperimentation, measurement \ntechniques, quantitative theories of \nbiomedical engineering, data analysis, \nand independent design of biomedical \nengineering experiments, in parallel to \nthe Biomedical engineering I & II and \nQuantitative physiology I & II courses. In \naddition, all students must take BMEN \nE4110: Biostatistics for engineers. In the \nsenior year, students are required to \ntake a two-semester capstone design \ncourse, Biomedical engineering design \n(BMEN E3910 and E3920), in which \nstudents work within a team to tackle \nan open-ended design project in \nbiomedical engineering. The underlying \nphilosophy of these core requirements \nis to provide our biomedical engineering \nstudents with a broad knowledge and \nunderstanding of topics in the field of \nbiomedical engineering. \nParallel to these studies in core \ncourses, students are required to take \nflexible technical elective courses, which \nare defined in the following section. The \ncurriculum prepares students who wish to \npursue careers in medicine by satisfying \nmost requirements in the premedical pro-\ngrams with no more than three additional \ncourses.

Finally, a \ncross-listed course that is greater than \nor equal to 3000 level and with BMEN \nin its call letters will qualify as a BME \nEngineering Technical Elective.\nThe accompanying charts describe \nthe eight-semester degree program \nschedule of courses leading to the \nbachelor’s degree in biomedical \nengineering.\nThe undergraduate Biomedical \nEngineering program is designed to \nprovide a solid biomedical engineering \ncurriculum through its core requirements \nwhile providing flexibility to meet the \nindividualized interests of the students. \nAll students are encouraged to design \ntheir own educational paths through \ntechnical electives. The following \ngrouped courses provide a useful \nguide for students who wish to focus \ntheir studies in a particular Biomedical \nEngineering topic. The requirements \nfor these elective concentrations are \nidentical to those of the major’s course \nrequirements. To declare and earn \nthis designation a student must take \nat least four of the courses listed for \nthat concentration, and at least two of \nthose must be biomedical engineering \ncourses. It is not necessary to declare a \nconcentration for the B.S. program.\nBIOFABRICATION & NANOTECHNOLOGY\nMECE E3100:  Introduction to mechanics of fluids (3)\nMECE E3113:  Mechanics of solids            (3)\nMSAE E4090:  Nanotechnology            (3)\nMECE E4212:  Microelectromechanical systems (3)\nBMEN E4550:  Micro- and nanostructures in \n    cellular engineering             (3)\nBMEN E4580:  Foundations of nanobiotechnology \nand nanobioscience             (3)\nBMEN E4590:  BioMems: cellular and molecular \napplications (3)\nBIOINFORMATICS & MACHINE LEARNING\nBIOL UN3041: Cell biology             (3) \nCOMS W3101:  Programming languages             (1)\nCOMS W3137: Data structures and algorithms  (4)\nBINF G4006: Translational bioinformatics         (3)\nBINF G4015: Computational systems biology:  \n proteins, networks, function          (3)\nECBM E4040: Neural networks and deep  \n learning              (3)\nECBM E4060:  Introduction to genomic \ninformation science and \ntechnology              (3)\nSTAT GU4241: Statistical machine learning       (3)\nCOMS W4252: Introduction to computational  \n learning theory             (3)\nBMEN E4420: Biomedical signal processing and  \n signal modeling             (3)\nBMEN E4460: Deep learning in biomedical  \n imaging              (3)\nBMEN E4470: Deep learning in biomedical  \n signal processing             (3)\n69\nENGINEERING 2024–2025\nBIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING: THIRD AND FOURTH YEARS\nSEMESTER V SEMESTER VI SEMESTER VII SEMESTER VIII\nREQUIRED  \nCOURSES\nBMEN E3010 (3)\nBiomedical eng., I\nBMEN E3810 (3)\nBME laboratory, I\nBMEN E4001 (3)\nQuantitative physiol., I\nBMEN E4110 (4)\nBiostat. for engineers\nBMEN E3020 (3)\nBiomedical eng., II\nBMEN E3820 (3)\nBME laboratory, II\nBMEN E4002 (3)\nQuantitative physiol., II\nTechnical elective (3)1\nBMEN E3910 (4)\nBME design, I\nTechnical elective (3)1\nTechnical elective (3)1\nTechnical elective (3)1\nBMEN E3920 (4)\nBME design, II\nTechnical elective (3)1\nTechnical elective (3)1\nTechnical elective (3)1\nNONTECH  \nELECTIVES 3 points 3 points 3 points\nTOTAL POINTS 16 15 16 13\n1 Five of seven technical electives must have engineering content, and two of them must be from the Biomedical Engineering Department.", "source": "pdfs/columbia engineering 2024-2025.pdf"}

For more information on \nrequirements and application process, \nplease visit bme.columbia.edu.\nGRADUATE PROGRAMS\nThe graduate curriculum in biomedical \nengineering is track-free. Initial graduate \nstudy in biomedical engineering is \ndesigned to expand the student’s \nundergraduate preparation in the \ndirection of the concentration \nof interest. In addition, sufficient \nknowledge is acquired in other areas \nto facilitate broad appreciation of \nproblems and effective collaboration \nwith specialists from other scientific, \nmedical, and engineering disciplines. \nThe Department of Biomedical \nEngineering offers a graduate program \nleading to the Master of Science degree \n(M.S.), the Doctor of Philosophy degree \n(Ph.D.), and the Doctor of Engineering \nScience degree (Eng.Sc.D.). Applicants \nwho have a Master of Science degree \nor equivalent may apply directly to the \ndoctoral degree program. All applicants \nare expected to have earned the \nbachelor’s degree in engineering or \nin a cognate scientific program. The \nGraduate Record Examination (General \nTest only) is optional of all applicants. \nStudents whose bachelor’s degree was \nnot earned in a country where English \nis the dominant spoken language are \nrequired to take the TOEFL, IELTS, PTE \nAcademic, or Duolingo English Test.\nColumbia Engineering does not \nadmit students holding the bachelor’s \ndegree directly to doctoral studies; \nadmission is offered either to the M.S. \nprogram or to the M.S. program/doctoral \ntrack. The Department of Biomedical \nEngineering also admits students into \nthe 4-2 program, which provides the \nopportunity for students holding a \nbachelor’s degree from certain physical \nsciences to receive the M.S. degree \nafter two years of study at Columbia .\nM.S. students must complete the \nprofessional development and leadership \ncourse, ENGI E4000, as a graduation \nrequirement. Doctoral students will \nbe enrolled in ENGI E6001–6004 and \nshould consult their program for specific \nPDL requirements.\nCURRICULUM AND EXAM \nREQUIREMENTS\nMaster’s Degree\nIn consultation with an appointed faculty \nadviser, M.S. students should select \na program of 30 points of credit of \ngraduate courses (4000-level or above) \nappropriate to their career goals. This \nprogram must include the course in \ncomputational modeling of physiological \nsystems (BMEN E6003); two semesters \nof BMEN E9700: Biomedical \nengineering seminar; at least four other \nbiomedical engineering courses where \nBM is in its call letters; and at least one \ngraduate-level course in the Applied \nMathematics department. Up to 6 credits \nof Master’s Research BMEN E9100 may \nbe taken to fulfill degree requirements. \nUp to 3 credits of coursework outside of \nSEAS may count toward the MS degree. \nStudents with deficiency in physiology \ncoursework are required to take the \nBMEN E4001-E4002 sequence before \ntaking BMEN E6003. Candidates must \nachieve a minimum grade-point average \nof 2.5. A thesis based on experimental, \ncomputational, or analytical research \nis optional.

These candidates are expected \nto complete their Ph.D. program within \n3.5 years, with otherwise the same \nrequirements as those outlined for the \nDoctoral Degree program.\nDoctoral Qualifying Examination\nDoctoral candidates are required to \npass a qualifying examination. This \nexamination is given once a year, and \nit should be taken after the student has \ncompleted 30 points of graduate study. \nThe qualifying examination consists of \nan oral exam during which the student \npresents an analysis of assigned \nscientific papers, as well as answers to \nquestions in topics covering applied \nmathematics, quantitative biology \nand physiology, and research-related \nmaterial. The committee consists of the \nthesis adviser and two BME core faculty \nmembers approved by the graduate \nstudies committee. A written analysis of \nthe assigned scientific papers must \nbe submitted prior to the oral exam. \nA minimum cumulative grade-point \naverage of 3.2 without research \ncredit grades is required to register \nfor this examination.\nDoctoral Committee and Thesis\nStudents who pass the qualifying \nexamination must have a core BME faculty \nmember who will serve as their primary \nresearch adviser or co-adviser. Each \nstudent is expected to submit a research \nproposal and present it to a committee \nthat consists of three BME faculty \nmembers (two must be core BME faculty \nmembers, including research adviser) \nbefore the end of year 4. The committee \nconsiders the scope of the proposed \nresearch, its suitability for doctoral \nresearch and the appropriateness of \nthe research plan. The committee may \napprove the proposal without reservation \nor may recommend modifications. In \ngeneral, the student is expected to \nsubmit their research proposal after \nfive semesters of doctoral studies. In \naccordance with regulations of the \nGraduate School of Arts and Sciences, \neach student is expected to submit a \nthesis and defend it before a committee \nof five faculty, one of whom holds primary \nappointment in another department \nor school or university. Every doctoral \ncandidate is required to have had at least \none first-author full-length paper accepted \nfor publication in a peer-reviewed journal \nprior to recommendation for award of the \ndegree.", "source": "pdfs/columbia engineering 2024-2025.pdf"}

Practicing \nchemical engineers are in charge \nof the development and production \nof diverse materials and processes \nin traditional chemical industries as \nwell as many emerging new areas. \nChemical engineers in industry guide \nthe passage of the product from the \nlaboratory to the marketplace, from \nideas and prototypes to functioning \narticles and processes, from theory to \nreality. Chemical engineering research \nis broader still, applying the principles \nof chemical engineering to the study \nand design of systems in biochemistry \nor environmental science, energy, \nadvanced materials, and more.\nThe expertise of chemical engineers \nis essential to production, marketing, \nand application in such areas as \nrenewable energy, pharmaceuticals, \nhigh-performance materials in the \naerospace and automotive industries, \nbiotechnologies, semiconductors in \nthe electronics industry, paints and \nplastics, synthetic fibers, artificial organs, \nbiocompatible implants and prosthetics \nand numerous others. Increasingly, \nchemical engineers are involved in new \ntechnologies employing highly novel \nmaterials, whose unusual response at \nthe molecular level endows them with \nunique properties. Examples include \nenvironmental technologies, emerging \nbiotechnologies of major medical \nimportance employing DNA- or protein-\nbased chemical sensors, controlled-\nrelease drugs, new agricultural \nproducts, nanoparticle-based materials, \nbio-nanoparticle conjugates, and many \nothers.\nDriven by this diversity of \napplications, chemical engineering is \nperhaps the broadest of all engineering \ndisciplines, drawing upon physics, \nchemistry, biology, mathematics and \ndata science, and design. Some of the \nareas under active investigation are \nprotein engineering, fundamentals and \nengineering of polymers, biopolymers, \nand other soft materials, colloidal \nmachines, atmospheric chemistry and air \nquality, fundamentals and applications \nof electrochemistry for energy storage \nand manufacturing, multiphase \nflows, carbon capture and utilization, \ncatalysis, and electrocatalysis, solar \nfuels, embryogenesis, the engineering \nand biochemistry of sequencing the \nhuman genome, emergent phenomena \nin complex and dynamical systems, \nthe biophysics of cellular processes \nin living organisms, and DNA-guided \nassembly of inorganic and biological \nnanoscale objects. Diverse experimental \napproaches are employed, from NMR, \nto urban field measurements using \nsensor networks, to synchrotron \ntechniques, and the theoretical work \ninvolves analytical mathematical physics, \nnumerical simulations, and data science.\nInterested students will have the \nopportunity to conduct research in \nthese and other areas. The Department \nof Chemical Engineering at Columbia \nis committed to a leadership role in \nresearch and education in frontier \nareas of research and technology \nwhere progress derives from the \nconjunction of many different traditional \nresearch disciplines. Increasingly, \nnew technologies and fundamental \nresearch questions demand this type of \ninterdisciplinary approach.\nThe undergraduate program \nprovides a chemical engineering degree \nthat is a passport to many careers in \ndirectly related industries as diverse as \nbiochemical engineering, environmental \nmanagement, and pharmaceuticals. \nThe degree is also used by many \nstudents as a springboard from which \nto launch careers in medicine, law, \nconsulting, management, finance, \nand so on. For those interested in the \nfundamentals, a career of research and \nteaching is a natural continuation of \ntheir undergraduate studies.

A commitment to life-long learning \nand service within their chosen \nprofession. \nUpon graduation, we expect our \nstudents to have:\n1. an ability to identify, formulate, and \nsolve complex engineering problems \nby applying principles of engineering, \nscience, and mathematics\n2. an ability to apply engineering design \nto produce solutions that meet \nspecified needs with consideration \nof public health, safety, and welfare, \nas well as global, cultural, social, \nenvironmental, and economic factors\n3. an ability to communicate effectively \nwith a range of audiences\n4. an ability to recognize ethical and \nprofessional responsibilities in \nengineering situations and make \ninformed judgments, which must \nconsider the impact of engineering \nsolutions in global, economic, \nenvironmental, and societal contexts\n5. an ability to function effectively on \nteams whose members together \nprovide leadership, create a \ncollaborative and inclusive \nenvironment, establish goals, plan \ntasks, and meet objectives\n6. an ability to develop and conduct \nappropriate experimentation, \nanalyze and interpret data, and \nuse engineering judgment to draw \nconclusions\n7. an ability to acquire and apply \nnew knowledge as needed, using \nappropriate learning strategies.\nColumbia’s program in chemical \nengineering leading to the B.S. degree \nis accredited by the Engineering \nAccreditation Commission of ABET, \nhttp://www.abet.org. \nThe first and sophomore years of \nstudy introduce general principles \nof science and engineering and \ninclude a broad range of subjects in \nthe humanities and social sciences. \nAlthough the program for all \nengineering students in these first two \nyears is to some extent similar, there \nare a few important differences for \nchemical engineering majors. Those \nwishing to learn about, or major in, \nchemical engineering should take the \nprofessional elective CHEN E1000 \nChemical engineering for humanity \nin term I, taught by the Chemical \nEngineering Department. This course \nprovides a broad overview of modern \nchemical engineering. Those wishing to \nmajor in chemical engineering should \nalso take ENGI E1006 Introduction \nto computing for engineering and \napplied scientists in term II.

Twenty-\none points (7 courses) of technical \nelectives are included in the junior and \nsenior year requirements. Technical \nelectives are science and/or technology \nbased and feature quantitative analysis. \nGenerally, technical electives must be \n3000 level or above but there are a few \nexceptions including: PHYS UN1403, \nPHYS UN2601, BIOL UN2005, BIOL \nUN2006, BIOL UN2501, and CHEM \nUN2444.

It offers both \nB.S. and M.S. degrees.\nThe program covers some of \nengineering’s most active, exciting, \nand critical areas, which lie at the \ninterface between CS and EE. The \nfocus of the major is on computer \nsystems involving both digital \nhardware and software.\nSome of the key topics covered \nare computer design (i.e., computer \narchitecture); embedded systems (i.e., \nthe design of dedicated hardware/\nsoftware for cell phones, automobiles, \nrobots, games, and aerospace); digital \nand VLSI circuit design; computer \nnetworks; design automation (i.e., CAD); \nand parallel and distributed systems \n(including architectures, programming, \nand compilers).\nStudents in the programs have two \n“home” departments. The Electrical \nEngineering Department maintains \nstudent records and coordinates \nadvising appointments.\nUNDERGRADUATE PROGRAM\nThis undergraduate program \nincorporates most of the core curricula \nin both electrical engineering and \ncomputer science so that students \nwill be well prepared to work in the \narea of computer engineering, which \nsubstantially overlaps both fields. Both \nhardware and software aspects of \ncomputer science are included, and, \nin electrical engineering, students \nreceive a solid grounding in circuit \ntheory and in electronic circuits. The \nprogram includes several electrical \nengineering laboratory courses as well \nas the Computer Science Department’s \nadvanced programming course. \nDetailed lists of requirements can be \nfound at compeng.columbia.edu.\nStudents will be prepared to work \non all aspects of the design of digital \nhardware, as well as on the associated \nsoftware that is now often an integral \npart of computer architecture. They will \nalso be well equipped to work in the \ngrowing field of telecommunications. \nStudents will have the prerequisites \nto delve more deeply into either \nhardware or software areas, and enter \ngraduate programs in computer science, \nelectrical engineering, or computer \nengineering. For example, they could \ntake more advanced courses in VLSI, \ncommunications theory, computer \narchitecture, electronic circuit theory, \nsoftware engineering, or digital design.\nMinors in electrical engineering \nand computer science are not open to \ncomputer engineering majors, due to \nexcessive overlap.\nTechnical Electives\nThe Computer Engineering Program \nincludes 15 points of technical \nelectives. All must be 3000 level or \nabove, technical, and must not have \nsignificant overlap with other courses \ntaken for the major. Adviser approval \nof technical electives is required.\nMost courses at the 3000 level \nor above offered by the Computer \nScience and Electrical Engineering \ndepartments are eligible, and up to \ntwo from outside those departments \ncan be considered for approval \nas well. If a department advertises \nthat one of its courses can be used \nas a technical elective that does \nnot necessarily mean it will be \napproved as a technical elective in \nthe computer engineering program. \nThere must be sufficient technical \ncontent and computer engineering \nconnection within the entire 15 \npoints, so approval of some courses \nmay depend on the other electives \nchosen. Economics courses cannot \nbe used as technical electives.

Resources are \nidentified as minerals, energy, water, \nair, and land, as well as the physical, \nchemical, and biological components \nof the environment. There is close \ncollaboration with other engineering \ndisciplines, the Lamont-Doherty Earth \nObservatory, the International Research \nInstitute for Climate Prediction, the \nCenter for Environmental Research and \nConservation, and other Columbia Earth \nInstitute units.\nTHE HENRY KRUMB SCHOOL \nOF MINES AT COLUMBIA \nUNIVERSITY\nThe department is the direct lineage \nof the School of Mines of Columbia \nUniversity, which was the first mining \nand metallurgy school in the U.S. \n(1864). It became the foundation for \nColumbia’s School of Engineering and \nApplied Science and later the home of \nthe Department of Mining, Metallurgical \nand Mineral Engineering. However, the \ntitle \"School of Mines\" was retained \nby Columbia University honoris causa. \nY ou can see the bronze statue of The \nMetallurgist (Le Marteleur) in front of \nColumbia's Mudd Hall that was named \nafter an alumnus of the School of Mines.\nOne century after its formation, the \nSchool of Mines was renamed Henry \nKrumb School of Mines (HKSM) in \nhonor of the generous alumnus of the \nSchool of Mines and his wife, Lavon \nDuddleson Krumb. HKSM has been \na leader in mining and metallurgy \nresearch and education, including the \nfirst mining handbook by Professor \nPeel, the first mineral processing \nhandbook by Professor Taggart, and \nother pioneering work in mineral \nbenefaction, chemical thermodynamics, \nkinetics, transport phenomena in mineral \nextraction and processing, ecological \nand environmentally responsible mining, \nand pursuit of state-of-the-art research \nadvancing responsible use of Earth's \nresources. The Henry Krumb School \nof Mines located in The Fu Foundation \nSchool of Engineering and Applied \nScience offers students interested in \nmining and metallurgy the opportunity \nto focus their studies in these fields \nwithin the department of Earth and \nEnvironmental Engineering.\nIn 1986, HKSM was designated by \nGovernor Cuomo as the mining and \nMineral Resources Research Institute of \nthe State of New Y ork.\nEARTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL \nENGINEERING (EEE)\nWith the creation of the Earth Institute \nat Columbia University, a major \ninitiative in the study of Earth, its \nenvironment and society, the traditional \nprograms of HKSM in mining, mineral \nprocessing, and extractive metallurgy \nwere expanded in the late nineties to \nencompass environmental concerns \nrelated to the use of materials, energy \nand water resources, and to reflect \none of nine departments of SEAS \nwith a focus on the development \nand application of technology for the \nsustainable development, use and \nintegrated management of Earth's \nresources.\nAs a result of the vast developments \nin the technologies and fields of \nenvironmental management, in 1996 \nand 1998, respectively, the engineering \nschool created the M.S. program in \nEarth Resources Engineering and the \nB.S. program in Earth and Environmental \nEngineering to meet the needs of a \nchanged society.

Doctoral \nstudents will be enrolled in ENGI E6001–\n6004 and should consult their program \nfor specific PDL requirements.\nM.S. in Earth and Environmental \nEngineering (M.S.-EEE)\nThe M.S.-EEE program is designed \nfor engineers and scientists who plan \nto pursue, or are already engaged \nin, environmental management/\ndevelopment careers. The focus of the \nprogram is the environmentally sound \nmining and processing of primary \nmaterials (minerals, energy, and water) \nto the recycling and proper disposal \nof used materials. The program also \nincludes technologies for assessment \nand remediation of damages to the \nenvironment including water treatment, \nprocessing of mine tailings, and carbon \ncapture, utilization and storage. Students \ncan choose a pace that allows them to \ncomplete the M.S.-EEE requirements \nwhile being employed.\nM.S.-EEE graduates are specially \nqualified to work for engineering, \nfinancial startup, and operating \ncompanies engaged in the earth \nresources development and \nenvironmental industries and \ntechnologies, environmental groups in all \nindustries, and for city, state, and federal \nagencies responsible for the environment \nand energy/resource conservation. At \nthe present time, the U.S. environmental \nindustry comprises nearly 30,000 big \nand small businesses with total revenues \nof more than $150 billion. Sustainable \ndevelopment, climate change adaptation \nand mitigation, as well as environmental \nquality have become top priorities of \ngovernment and industries in the United \nStates and many other nations.\nThis M.S. program is offered in \ncollaboration with the Departments \nof Civil Engineering and Earth and \nEnvironmental Sciences. Many of the \nteaching faculty are affiliated with \nColumbia’s Earth Engineering Center. \nFor students with a B.S. in engineering, \nat least 30 points (ten courses) are \nrequired. Students may carry out a \nresearch project (3 credits) or write a \nthesis worth 6 points. A number of areas \nof study are available for the M.S.-EEE, \nand students may choose courses that \nmatch their interest and career plans.\nAdditionally, there are three \noptional concentrations in the \nprogram, in each of which there \nare a number of required specific \ncore courses and electives. The \nconcentrations are described briefly \nbelow; details and the lists of specific \ncourses for each track are available \nfrom the department. Students \ninterested in a specific focus in \nMining Engineering or related fields \nshould consult their faculty adviser for \nrelevant course listings.\nWater Resources and  \nClimate Risks\nClimate-induced risk is a significant \ncomponent of decision making for \nthe planning, design, and operation \nof water resource systems, and \nrelated sectors such as energy, health, \nagriculture, ecological resources, \nand natural hazards control. Climatic \nuncertainties can be broadly classified \ninto two areas: (1) those related to \nanthropogenic climate change; (2) \nthose related to seasonal- to century-\nscale natural variations. Climate change \nimpacts the design of physical, social, \nand financial infrastructure systems to \nsupport the sectors listed above. The \nclimate variability and predictability \nissues impact systems operation, and \nhence design. The goal of the M.S. \nconcentration in water resources and \nclimate risks is to provide (1) a capacity \nfor understanding and quantifying the \nprojections for climate change and \nvariability in the context of decisions \nfor water resources and related sectors \nof impact; and (2) skills for integrated \nrisk assessment and management \nfor operations and design, as well \nas for regional policy analysis and \nmanagement. Required classes include:\n• EACE E4250 Hydrosystems \nEngineering\n• EACE E4163 Sustainable water \ntreatment and reuse\n• EAEE E4257 Environmental data \nanalysis and modeling\nSustainable Energy\nBuilding and shaping the energy \ninfrastructure of the twenty-first century \nis one of the central tasks for modern \nengineering. The purpose of the \nsustainable energy concentration is \nto expose students to modern energy \ntechnologies and infrastructures and to \nthe associated environmental, health, \nand resource limitations. Emphasis \nwill be on energy generation and use \ntechnologies that aim to overcome the \nlimits to growth that are experienced \ntoday. Energy and economic well-\nbeing are tightly coupled. Fossil fuel \nresources are still plentiful, but access \nto energy is limited by environmental \nand economic constraints. A future \nworld population of 10 billion people \ntrying to approach the standard of \nliving of the developed nations cannot \nrely on today’s energy technologies \nand infrastructures without severe \nenvironmental impacts. Concerns over \nclimate change and changes in ocean \nchemistry require reductions in carbon \ndioxide emissions, but most alternatives \nto conventional fossil fuels, including \nnuclear energy, are too expensive to \nfill the gap. Y et access to clean, cheap \nenergy is critical for providing minimal \nresources: water, food, housing, and \ntransportation.\nConcentration-specific classes will \nsketch out the availability of resources, \ntheir geographic distribution, the \neconomic and environmental cost of \nresource extraction, and avenues for \nincreasing energy utilization efficiency, \nsuch as cogeneration, district heating, \nand distributed generation of energy. \nClasses will discuss technologies \nfor efficiency improvement in the \ngeneration and consumption sector; \nenergy recovery from solid wastes; \nalternatives to fossil fuels, including \nsolar and wind energy, energy storage; \nand technologies for addressing the \nenvironmental concerns over the use of \nfossil fuels. Classes on climate change, \nair quality, and health impacts focus on \nthe consequences of energy use. Policy \nand its interactions with environmental \nsciences and energy engineering will \nbe another aspect of the concentration. ", "source": "pdfs/columbia engineering 2024-2025.pdf"}

A common theme is \nthe use of electrical and electromagnetic \nsignals for the generation, transmission, \nprocessing, storage, conversion, and \ncontrol of information and energy. An \nequally important aspect is the human \ninterface and the role of individuals as \nthe sources and recipients of information. \nThe rates at which information is \ntransmitted today range from megabits \nper second to gigabits per second and \nin some cases, as high as terabits per \nsecond. The range of frequencies over \nwhich these processes are studied \nextends from direct current (i.e., zero \nfrequency), to microwave and optical \nfrequencies.\nThe need for increasingly faster and \nmore sophisticated methods of handling \ninformation poses a major challenge to \nthe electrical engineer. New materials, \ndevices, systems, and network concepts \nare needed to build the advanced \ncommunications and information \nhandling systems of the future. \nInnovations in electrical engineering \nhave had a dramatic impact on the way \nin which we work and live: the transistor, \nintegrated circuits, computers, radio and \ntelevision, satellite transmission systems, \nlasers, fiber optic transmission systems, \nand medical electronics.\nThe faculty of the Electrical \nEngineering Department at Columbia \nUniversity is dedicated to the \ncontinued development of further \ninnovations through its program of \nacademic instruction and research. Our \nundergraduate program in electrical \nengineering is designed to prepare \nstudents for a career in industry, research, \nor business by providing them with a \nthorough foundation of the fundamental \nconcepts and analytical tools of \ncontemporary electrical engineering. A \nwide range of elective courses permits \nthe student to emphasize specific \ndisciplines such as communications, \ndevices, circuits, or signal processing.\nUndergraduates have an opportunity \nto learn firsthand about current research \nactivities by participating in a program \nof undergraduate research projects with \nthe faculty.\nA master’s level program in electrical \nengineering permits graduate students \nto further specialize their knowledge and \nskills within a wide range of disciplines. \nFor those who are interested in \npursuing a career in teaching, research, \nor advanced development, our Ph.D. \nprogram offers the opportunity to conduct \nresearch under faculty supervision at the \nleading edge of technology and applied \nscience. Seminars are offered in all \nresearch areas.\nThe Electrical Engineering \nDepartment, along with the Computer \nScience Department, also offers \nB.S. and M.S. programs in computer \nengineering. Details on those programs \ncan be found in the Computer \nEngineering section in this bulletin.\nResearch Activities\nThe research interests of the faculty \nencompass a number of rapidly \ngrowing areas, vital to the development \nof future technology, that will affect \nalmost every aspect of society: signals, \ninformation, and data; networking and \ncommunications; nanoscale structures \n", "source": "pdfs/columbia engineering 2024-2025.pdf"}

More detailed \nprogram objectives and outcomes are \nposted at ee.columbia.edu.\nThe program in electrical \nengineering leading to the B.S. degree \nis accredited by the Engineering \nAccreditation Commission of ABET, \nhttp://www.abet.org.\nThere is a strong interaction \nbetween the Department of Electrical \nEngineering and the Departments of \nComputer Science, Applied Physics \nand Applied Mathematics, Industrial \nEngineering and Operations Research, \nPhysics, and Chemistry.\nEE Core Curriculum\nAll electrical engineering (EE) students \nmust take a set of core courses, which \ncollectively provide the student with \nfundamental skills, expose them to \nthe breadth of EE, and serve as a \nspringboard for more advanced work, or \nfor work in areas not covered in the core. \nThese courses are shown on the charts \nin Undergraduate Degree Tracks. A full \ncurriculum checklist is also posted at \nee.columbia.edu.\nTechnical Electives\nThe 18-point technical elective requirement \nfor the electrical engineering program \nconsists of three components: depth, \nbreadth, and other. A general outline is \nprovided here, and more specific course \nrestrictions can be found at ee.columbia.\nedu. For any course not clearly listed \nthere, adviser approval is necessary.\nThe depth component must consist of \nat least 6 points of electrical engineering \ncourses in one of four defined areas: \n(a) photonics, solid-state devices, \nand electromagnetics; (b) circuits and \nelectronics; (c) signals and systems; \nand (d) communications and networking. \nThe depth requirement provides an \nopportunity to pursue particular interests \nand exposure to the process of exploring \na discipline in depth—an essential \nprocess that can be applied later to other \ndisciplines, if desired.\nThe breadth component must consist \nof at least 6 additional points of courses \nthat are outside of the chosen depth \narea and have significant engineering \ncontent. These courses can be from \nother departments within the School. \nThe breadth requirement precludes \noverspecialization. Breadth is particularly \nimportant today, as innovation requires \nmore and more of an interdisciplinary \napproach, and exposure to other fields \nis known to help one’s creativity in one’s \nown main field. Breadth also reduces the \nchance of obsolescence as technology \nchanges.\nAny remaining technical elective \ncourses, beyond the minimum 12 points \nof depth and breadth, do not have to be \nengineering courses (except for students \nwithout ELEN E1201 or approved transfer \ncredit for ELEN E1201) but must be \ntechnical. Generally, math and science \ncourses that do not overlap with courses \nused to fill other requirements are \nallowed.\nIf another department advertises \nthat one of their courses can be used \nas a technical elective, that does not \nnecessarily mean it will be approved \nas a technical elective in the electrical \nengineering program. Which courses are \napproved depends on other electives \nchosen due to the depth and breadth \nrestrictions, and the need for sufficient \nengineering and technical content within \nthe entire 18 points. Electrical engineering \ntechnical electives must also be 3000 \nlevel or above and must not have \nsignificant overlap with other courses \ntaken for the major.\nStarting Early\nThe EE curriculum is designed to allow \nstudents to start their study of EE in their \nfirst year. This motivates students early \nand allows them to spread nontechnical \nrequirements more evenly. It also makes \nevident the need for advanced math \nand physics concepts, and motivates \nthe study of such concepts. Finally, it \nallows more time for students to take \nclasses in a chosen depth area, or \ngives them more time to explore before \nchoosing a depth area. Students can \nstart with ELEN E1201: Introduction to \nelectrical engineering in the second \nsemester of their first year, and can \ncontinue with other core courses one \nsemester after that, as shown in the \n“early-starting students” chart. It is \nemphasized that both the early- and \nlate-starting sample programs shown in \nthe charts are examples only; schedules \nmay vary depending on student \npreparation and interests.\nTransfer Students\nTransfer students coming to Columbia \nas juniors with sufficient general \nbackground can complete all \nrequirements for the B.S. degree in \nelectrical engineering. Such students fall \ninto one of two categories:\nPlan 1: Students coming to Columbia \nwithout having taken the equivalent of \nELEN E1201 must take this course in their \njunior year. This requires postponing the \ncore courses in circuits and electronics \nuntil the senior year, and thus does not \nallow taking electives in that area; thus, \nsuch students cannot choose circuits \nand electronics as a depth area.\nPlan 2: This plan is for students who \nhave taken a course equivalent to \nELEN E1201 at their school of origin, \nincluding a laboratory component. \nSee the bulletin for a description of \nthis course. Many pre-engineering \nprograms and physics departments at \nfour-year colleges offer such courses. \nSuch students can start taking circuits \nat Columbia immediately, and thus can \nchoose circuits and electronics as a \ndepth area.\nIt is stressed that ELEN E1201 or \nits equivalent is a key part of the EE \ncurriculum. The preparation provided by \nthis course is essential for a number of \nother core courses.\nSample programs for both Plan 1 and \nPlan 2 transfer students can be found at \nee.columbia.edu.\nB.S./M.S.

This double degree program \nmakes possible the earning of both \nthe Bachelor of Science and Master \nof Science degrees in an integrated \nfashion. Up to 6 points may be credited \nto both degrees, and some graduate \nclasses taken in the senior year may \ncount toward the M.S. degree. Interested \nstudents can find further information \nat ee.columbia.edu and can discuss \noptions directly with their faculty adviser. \nStudents must be admitted prior to \nthe start of their seventh semester at \nColumbia Engineering. Students in the \n3-2 Combined Plan undergraduate \nprogram are not eligible for admission to \nthis program.\nGRADUATE PROGRAMS\nThe Department of Electrical \nEngineering offers graduate programs \nleading to the degree of Master of \nScience (M.S.) and the degrees of \nDoctor of Engineering Science (Eng.\nSc.D.) and Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.). \nThe Graduate Record Examination \n(General Test only) is required of all \napplicants except special students. An \nundergraduate grade-point average \nequivalent to B or better from an \ninstitution comparable to Columbia is \nexpected.\nApplicants who, for good reasons, \nare unable to submit GRE test results \nby the deadline date but whose \nundergraduate record is clearly superior \nmay file an application without the GRE \nscores. An explanatory note should be \nadded to ensure that the application will \nbe processed even while incomplete. If \nthe candidate’s admissibility is clear, the \ndecision may be made without the GRE \nscores; otherwise, it may be deferred \nuntil the scores are received.\nThere are no prescribed course \nrequirements in any of the regular \ngraduate degree programs. Students, in \nconsultation with their faculty advisers, \ndesign their own programs, focusing on \nparticular fields of electrical engineering. \nAmong the fields of graduate study are \nCommunications, Networking, Internet \nand Internet of Things; Computer \nEngineering; Integrated Circuits and \nSystems and Electronics; Integrated \nDevices and Photonics; Signals, \nInformation, Data, Learning and Control; \nSmart Electric Energy; and Systems \nBiology and Neuroengineering.\nGraduate course charts for \nseveral focus areas can be found at \nee.columbia.edu.\nM.S. students must complete \nthe professional development and \nleadership course, ENGI E4000, as \na graduation requirement. Doctoral \nstudents will be enrolled in ENGI E6001–\n6004 and should consult their program \nfor specific PDL requirements.\nMaster of Science Degree\nCandidates for the M.S. degree in \nelectrical engineering must complete 30 \npoints of credit beyond the bachelor’s \ndegree. A minimum of 15 points of credit \nmust be at the 6000 level or higher. No \ncredit will be allowed for undergraduate \ncourses (3000 or lower). At least 15 \npoints must be in electrical engineering, \ndefined as including all courses with an \nELEN designator or a joint designator \ncontaining electrical engineering as a \nmember, e.g., EECS, CSEE, EEME, ECBM, \netc. And it is expected that at least 12 \nof the first 24 points taken will be in \nelectrical engineering.\nNot all technical courses can be \napplied toward the M.S. degree, and \nsome have restrictions. Up to 6 points \nof research (such as ELEN E4998, \nELEN E6001, and ELEN E6002) can be \napplied. Up to 1.5 points of fieldwork \n(ELEN E6999) can be used. No more \nthan 3 points of courses that do not \ncontain primarily engineering, math, or \nscience content can be used, subject \nto the written pre-approval of the \ndepartment. Any course that is not on \nthe list of standard courses specified \nat ee.columbia.edu/masters-program \nrequires prior written department \napproval, including during the summer \nsession.\nThe general school requirements \nlisted earlier in this bulletin, such as \nminimum GPA, must also be satisfied. \nAll degree requirements must be \ncompleted within five years of the \nbeginning of the first course credited \ntoward the degree.\nMore details and a requirements \nchecklist for approvals can be found at \nee.columbia.edu/masters-program.\nDoctoral Degree\nThe requirements for the Ph.D. and Eng.\nSc.D. degrees are identical. Both require \na dissertation based on the candidate’s \noriginal research, conducted under the \nsupervision of a faculty member. The \nwork may be theoretical or experimental \nor both.\nStudents who wish to become \ncandidates for the doctoral degree in \nelectrical engineering have the option of \napplying for admission to the Eng.Sc.D. \nprogram or the Ph.D. program. Students \nwho elect the Eng.Sc.D. degree register \nin the School of Engineering and \nApplied Science; those who elect the \nPh.D. degree register in the Graduate \nSchool of Arts and Sciences.\nDoctoral candidates must obtain a \nminimum of 60 points of formal course \ncredit beyond the bachelor’s degree. \nA master’s degree from an accredited \ninstitution may be accepted as \nequivalent to 30 points. A minimum of \n30 points beyond the master’s degree \nmust be earned while in residence in \nthe doctoral program.\nMore detailed information regarding \nthe requirements for the doctoral \ndegree may be obtained in the \ndepartment office and at ee.columbia.\nedu.\nOptional M.S. Specializations\nStudents in the electrical engineering \nM.S. program often choose to use \nsome of their electives to focus on \na particular field. Students may pick \none of a number of optional, formal \nspecialization templates or design their \nown M.S. program in consultation with \nan adviser. These specializations are not \ndegree requirements. They represent \nsuggestions from the faculty as to how \none might fill one’s programs so as to \nfocus on a particular area of interest. \nStudents may wish to follow these \nsuggestions, but they need not. The \ndegree requirements are quite flexible \nand are listed in the Master of Science \nDegree section, above. All students, \nwhether following a formal specialization \ntemplate or not, are expected to include \nbreadth in their program. Not all of the \nelective courses listed here are offered \nevery year.

Mudd, MC 4704\n212-854-2941\nieor.columbia.edu\nINDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING AND OPERATIONS RESEARCH\nI\nndustrial engineering is the branch \nof the engineering profession \nthat is concerned with the design, \nanalysis, and control of production and \nservice systems. Originally, an industrial \nengineer worked in a manufacturing \nplant and was involved only with the \noperating efficiency of workers and \nmachines. Today, industrial engineers \nare more broadly concerned with \nproductivity and all of the technical \nproblems of production management \nand control. They may be found in every \nkind of organization: manufacturing, \ndistribution, transportation, mercantile, \nand service. Their responsibilities range \nfrom the design of unit operations to \nthat of controlling complete production \nand service systems. Their jobs involve \nthe integration of the physical, financial, \neconomic, computer, and human \ncomponents of such systems to attain \nspecified goals. Industrial engineering \nincludes activities such as production \nplanning and control; quality control; \ninventory, equipment, warehouse, and \nmaterials management; plant layout; and \nworkstation design.\nOperations research is concerned \nwith quantitative decision problems, \ngenerally involving the allocation and \ncontrol of limited resources. Such \nproblems arise, for example, in the \noperations of industrial firms, financial \ninstitutions, health care organizations, \ntransportation systems, and government. \nThe operations research analyst \ndevelops and uses mathematical and \nstatistical models to help solve these \ndecision problems. Like engineers, they \nare problem formulators and solvers. \nTheir work requires the formation of \na mathematical model of a system \nand the analysis and prediction of the \nconsequences of alternate modes of \noperating the system. The analysis \nmay involve mathematical optimization \ntechniques, probabilistic and statistical \nmethods, experiments, and computer \nsimulations.\nManagement Science and \nEngineering (also known as \nEngineering Management Systems) is a \nmultidisciplinary field integrating industrial \nengineering, operations research, \ncontemporary technology, business, \neconomics, and management. It provides \na foundation for decision making and \nmanaging risks in complex systems.\nFinancial engineering is a \nmultidisciplinary field integrating \nfinancial theory with economics, \nmethods of engineering, tools \nof mathematics, and practice of \nprogramming. The field provides \ntraining in the application of engineering \nmethodologies and quantitative \nmethods to finance.\nBusiness Analytics involves the \nuse of data science tools for solving \noperational and marketing problems. \nStudents learn to leverage advanced \nquantitative models, algorithms, and \ndata for making actionable decisions to \nimprove business operations.\nCurrent Research Activities\nIn industrial engineering, research \nis conducted in the area of logistics, \nrouting, scheduling, production and \nsupply chain management, inventory \ncontrol, revenue management, and \nquality control.\nCHAIR\nJay Sethuraman\n326 S.

Lect: 1.5. \nPrerequisite(s): IEOR E4700. Foreign exchange \nmarket and its related derivative instruments—the \nlatter being forward contracts, futures, options, \nand exotic options. What is unusual about foreign \nexchange is that although it can rightfully claim to \nbe the largest of all financial markets, it remains \nan area where very few have any meaningful \nexperience. Virtually everyone has traded stocks, \nbonds, and mutual funds. Comparatively few indi -\nviduals have ever traded foreign exchange. In part \nthat is because foreign exchange is an interbank \nmarket. Ironically the foreign exchange markets \nmay be the best place to trade derivatives and \nto invent new derivatives—given the massive \ntwo-way flow of trading that goes through bank \ndealing rooms virtually 24 hours a day. And most \nof that is transacted at razor-thin margins, at least \ncomparatively speaking, a fact that makes the \nforeign exchange market an ideal platform for \nderivatives.

{"page_index": 190, "page_content": "186\nENGINEERING 2024–2025186\nM\nechanical engineering is a \ndiverse subject that derives \nits breadth from the need to \ndesign and manufacture everything from \nsmall individual parts/devices (e.g., micro-\nscale sensors, inkjet printer nozzles) \nto large systems (e.g., spacecraft and \nmachine tools). The role of a mechanical \nengineer is to take a product from an \nidea to the marketplace. In order to \naccomplish this, a broad range of skills \nare needed. The particular skills in \nwhich the mechanical engineer acquires \ndeeper knowledge are the ability to \nunderstand the forces and the thermal \nenvironment that a product, its parts, or its \nsubsystems will encounter; design them \nfor functionality, aesthetics, and the ability \nto withstand the forces and the thermal \nenvironment they will be subjected to; \ndetermine the best way to manufacture \nthem and ensure they will operate \nwithout failure. Perhaps the one skill that \nis the mechanical engineer’s exclusive \ndomain is the ability to analyze and \ndesign objects and systems with motion. \nSince these skills are required \nfor virtually everything that is made, \nmechanical engineering is perhaps \nthe broadest and most diverse of \nengineering disciplines. Hence \nmechanical engineers play a central \nrole in such industries as automotive \n(from the car chassis to its every \nsubsystem—engine, transmission, \nsensors); aerospace (airplanes, aircraft \nengines, control systems for airplanes \nand spacecraft); biotechnology \n(implants, prosthetic devices, fluidic \nsystems for pharmaceutical industries); \ncomputers and electronics (disk drives, \nprinters, cooling systems, semiconductor \ntools); microelectromechanical systems, \nor MEMS (sensors, actuators, micro \npower generation); energy conversion \n(gas turbines, wind turbines, solar \nenergy, fuel cells); environmental \ncontrol (HVAC, air-conditioning, \nrefrigeration, compressors); automation \n(robots, data/image acquisition, \nrecognition, and control); manufacturing \n(machining, machine tools, prototyping, \nmicrofabrication). \nTo put it simply, mechanical \nengineering deals with anything \nthat moves. Mechanical engineers \nlearn about materials, solid and fluid \nmechanics, thermodynamics, heat \ntransfer, control, instrumentation, \ndesign, and manufacturing to realize/ \nunderstand mechanical systems. \nSpecialized mechanical engineering \nsubjects include biomechanics, cartilage \ntissue engineering, energy conversion, \nlaser-assisted materials processing, \ncombustion, MEMS, microfluidic devices, \nfracture mechanics, nanomechanics, \nmechanisms, micropower generation, \ntribology (friction and wear), and \nvibrations. The American Society of \nMechanical Engineers (ASME) currently \nlists thirty-six technical divisions, \nfrom advanced energy systems and \naerospace engineering to safety \nengineering and tribology. \nThe breadth of the mechanical \nengineering discipline allows students \na variety of career options beyond \nsome of the industries listed above. \nRegardless of the particular future path \nthey envision for themselves after they \ngraduate, their education would have \nprovided them with the creative thinking \nthat allows them to design an exciting \nproduct or system, the analytical tools \nto achieve their design goals, the ability \nto meet several sometimes conflicting \nconstraints, and the teamwork needed \nto design, market, and produce a \nsystem. These skills also prove to \nbe valuable in other endeavors and \ncan launch a career in medicine, law, \nconsulting, management, banking, \nfinance, and so on. \nFor those interested in applied \nscientific and mathematical aspects \nof the discipline, graduate study in \nmechanical engineering can lead to a \ncareer of research and teaching.\nCurrent Research Activities\nCurrent research activities in the \nDepartment of Mechanical Engineering \nare in the areas of controls and robotics, \nenergy and micropower generation, \nfluid mechanics, heat/mass transfer, \nmechanics of materials, manufacturing, \nmaterial processing, MEMS, \nnanotechnology, and biomechanics and \nbiofluids.\nMECHANICAL ENGINEERING\n220 S.

MEMS \ntechnology allows biomolecules to \nbe studied in well-controlled micro/\nnanoenvironments of miniaturized, \nintegrated devices, and may enable \nnovel biomedical investigations not \nattainable by conventional techniques. \nThe research interests center on the \ndevelopment of MEMS devices and \nsystems for label-free manipulation \nand interrogation of biomolecules. \nCurrent research efforts primarily involve \nmicrofluidic devices that exploit specific \nand reversible, stimulus-dependent \nbinding between biomolecules and \nreceptor molecules to enable selective \npurification, concentration, and \nlabel-free detection of nucleic acid, \nprotein, and small molecule analytes; \nminiaturized instruments for label-free \ncharacterization of thermodynamic \nand other physical properties of \nbiomolecules; and subcutaneously \nimplantable MEMS affinity biosensors for \ncontinuous monitoring of glucose and \nother metabolites. (Kysar, Lin)\nThe Kysar group has a project to \ndesign and develop a method to deliver \ntherapeutics into the inner ear through \nthe Round Window Membrane (RWM) \nthat serves as a portal for acoustic \nenergy between the middle ear and \ninner ear. This involves the design and \nfabrication of arrays of microneedles, \nthe measurements of diffusive flux of \nchemical species across a perforated \nRWM, and the design, delivery, and \ntesting of surgical tools, all in close \ncollaboration with Anil K. Lalwani, M.D., \nat Columbia University Medical Center. \n(Kysar)\nThe Schuck group is involved in \nengineering novel near-infrared (NIR) \nupconverting nanoparticles (UCNPs) and \nUCNP-based microdevices for large-\nscale sensing applications, including \ndeployment in projects aimed at deep-\ntissue imaging and the control of neural \nfunction deep within brain tissue. UCNPs \nhave the potential to overcome nearly \nall limitations of current optical probes \nand sensors, which have run into \nfundamental chemical and photophysical \nincompatibilities with living systems. \n(Schuck)\nMass radiological triage is critical \nafter a large-scale radiological event \nbecause of the need to identify \nthose individuals who will benefit \nfrom medical intervention as soon as \npossible. The goal of the ongoing NIH-\nfunded research project is to design \na prototype of a fully automated, ultra \nhigh throughput biodosimetry. This \nprototype is supposed to accommodate \nmultiple assay preparation protocols \nthat allow the determination of the \nlevels of radiation exposure that a \npatient received. The input to this fully \nautonomous system is a large number \nof capillaries filled with blood of patients \ncollected using finger sticks. These \ncapillaries are processed by the system \nto distill the micronucleus assay in \nlymphocytes, with all the assays being \ncarried out in situ in multiwell plates. The \nresearch effort on this project involves \nthe automation system design and \nintegration including hierarchical control \nalgorithms, design and control of custom \nbuilt robotic devices, and automated \nimage acquisition and processing for \nsample preparation and analysis. (Y ao)\nA technology that couples the \npower of multidimensional microscopy \n(three spatial dimensions, time, and \nmultiple wavelengths) with that of \nDNA array technology is investigated \nin an NIH-funded project. Specifically, \na system is developed in which \nindividual cells selected on the \nbasis of optically detectable multiple \nfeatures at critical time points in \ndynamic processes can be rapidly \nand robotically micromanipulated into \nreaction chambers to permit amplified \nDNA synthesis and subsequent array \nanalysis. Customized image processing \nand pattern recognition techniques \nare developed, including Fisher’s \nlinear discriminant preprocessing with \nneural net, a support vector machine \nwith improved training, multiclass cell \ndetection with error correcting output \ncoding, and kernel principal component \nanalysis.

It is accomplished by following \nthe procedures announced in advance \nof each term’s registration period.\nEnrollment is the completion of the \nregistration process and affords the full \nrights and privileges of student status. \nEnrollment is accomplished by the \npayment or other satisfaction of tuition \nand fees and by the satisfaction of other \nobligations to the University.\nRegistration alone does not guarantee \nenrollment nor does registration alone \nguarantee the right to participate in class. \nIn some cases, students will need to \nobtain the approval of the instructor, or \nof a representative of the department \nthat offers a course, or permission of \nthe School offering the class. Students \nshould check this bulletin, their \nregistration instructions, the Directory of \nClasses, and also with an adviser for all \napprovals that may be required.\nT o comply with current and \nanticipated Internal Revenue Service \nmandates, the University requires \nall students who will be receiving \nfinancial aid or payment through the \nUniversity payroll system to report their \nSocial Security number at the time of \nadmission. Newly admitted students who \ndo not have a Social Security number \nshould obtain one well in advance \nof their first registration. International \nstudents should consult theInternational \nStudents and Scholars Office, located at \n545 W. 112th Street, 4th Floor (212-854-\n3587), for further information. \nSpecial billing authorization is \nrequired of all students whose bills \nare to be sent to a third party for \npayment. Students who are not citizens \nof the United States and who need \nauthorization for special billing of tuition \nand/or fees to foreign institutions, \nagencies, or sponsors should go \nto the International Students and \nScholars Office with two copies of the \nsponsorship letter.\nUniversity Regulations\nEach person whose enrollment has \nbeen completed is considered a \nstudent of the University during the \nterm for which they are enrolled unless \ntheir connection with the University is \nofficially severed by being withdrawn \nor for other reasons. No student \nenrolled in any school or college of the \nUniversity shall at the same time be \nenrolled in any other school or college, \neither of Columbia University or of any \nother institution, without the specific \nauthorization of the dean or director of \nthe school or college of the University in \nwhich they are first enrolled.\nThe privileges of the University \nare not available to any student until \nenrollment has been completed. \nStudents are not permitted to attend any \nUniversity course for which they are not \nofficially enrolled or for which they have \nnot officially filed a program unless they \nhave been granted auditing privileges.\nThe University reserves the right to \nwithhold the privileges of registration \nand enrollment or any other University \nprivilege from any person who has \noutstanding financial, academic, or \nadministrative obligations to the University.\nContinuous registration until \ncompletion of all requirements is \nobligatory for each degree. Students \nare exempted from the requirement to \nregister continuously only when granted \na leave of absence by the Committee on \nAcademic Standing (for undergraduate \nstudents) or the Office of Engineering \nStudent Affairs (for graduate students).\nRegistration Instructions\nRegistration instructions are announced \nin advance of each registration period \nby the Registrar. Students should consult \nthese instructions for the exact dates \nand times of registration activities. \nStudents must be sure to obtain all \nnecessary written course approvals and \nadvisers’ signatures before registering. \nUndergraduate students who have \nnot registered for a full-time course \nload of at least 12 credits by the end of \nthe change of program period will be \nwithdrawn, as will graduate students \nwho have not registered for any \ncoursework by the end of the change of \nprogram period. International students \nenrolled in graduate degree programs \nmust maintain full-time status until \ndegree completion.\nDEGREE REQUIREMENTS AND \nSATISFACTORY PROGRESS\nUndergraduate\nUndergraduate students are \nrequired to complete the School’s \ndegree requirements and graduate \nin eight academic terms. Full-time \nundergraduate registration is defined \nas at least 12 credits per term. However, \nin order to complete the degree in 8 \nsemesters, students must be averaging \n16 credits per term. Students may not \nregister for point loads greater than 21 \npoints per term without approval from \nthe Committee on Academic Standing.\nTo be eligible to receive the Bachelor \nof Science degree, a student must \ncomplete the courses prescribed in \na faculty-approved major/program (or \nfaculty-authorized substitutions) and \nachieve a minimum cumulative grade-\npoint average (GPA) of 2.0. Although \nthe minimum number of academic \ncredits is 128 for the B.S. degree, some \nprograms of the School require a greater \nnumber of credits in order to complete \nall the requirements.

For \nindividual courses dropped after the \nend of the Change of Program period, \nthere will be no tuition refund. Failure \nto attend a class will be indicated by a \npermanent unofficial withdrawal (UW) on \nthe transcript.\n     In cases that have been referred for \ndisciplinary action through the Dean’s \nDiscipline process, undergraduate \nstudents may not drop from the course \nin question without a successful \npetition to the Committee on Academic \nStanding. Graduate students should \ncontact the Office of Engineering \nStudent Affairs. \nTransfer Credits\nUndergraduate students may obtain \nacademic credit toward the B.S. \ndegree by completing coursework at \nother accredited four-year institutions. \nNormally, this credit is earned during \nthe summer. To count as credit toward \nthe degree, a course taken elsewhere \nmust have an equivalent at Columbia \nUniversity and the student must achieve \na grade of at least B. An exception to \nthis policy is made for students enrolled \nin an approved study abroad program. \nStudents in an approved study abroad \nprogram will receive transfer credit if \nthey earn a grade of C or higher. To \ntransfer credit, a student must obtain \nprior approval from their CSA Advising \nDean and the department before taking \nsuch courses. A course description and \nsyllabus should be furnished as a part \nof the approval process. Courses taken \nbefore the receipt of the high school \ndiploma may not be credited toward the \nB.S. degree. A maximum of 6 credits \nmay be credited toward the degree \nfor college courses taken following the \nreceipt of a high school diploma and \ninitial enrollment at Columbia University.\nFor graduate students, Advanced \nStanding is granted in most cases \ninstead of transfer credits. Advanced \nStanding refers to a student receiving \ncredit towards their graduate degree \nprogram for previously completed \ngraduate-level coursework within the \nfollowing parameters: \nM.S. students in on-campus \nprograms can earn Advanced Standing \ntoward the M.S. degree for graduate-\nlevel coursework (4000 level or above) \ncompleted at Columbia University only. \nNo more than 15 points of Advanced \nStanding can be awarded, and the \ncoursework can not have been counted \ntowards a previous degree, minor, or \ncertificate program.

The grade of W, meaning \n“official withdrawal,” will be recorded as \nthe official grade for the course in lieu of \na letter grade. \nName Changes\nColumbia University recognizes that \nsome students prefer to identify \nthemselves by a First Name and/or \nMiddle Name, other than their Legal \nName. For this reason, beginning in the \nSpring 2016 semester, the University has \nenabled students to use a \"Preferred \nName\" where possible in the course of \nUniversity business and education.\nUnder Columbia's Preferred Name \npolicy, any student may choose to \nidentify a Preferred First and/or Middle \nName in addition to the Legal Name. \nStudents may request this service via a \nlink on SSOL. The student's Preferred \nName may be used in many University \ncontexts, including SSOL, class rosters, \nCourseWorks, and Canvas, and on ID \nCards. For some other records, the \nUniversity is legally required to use \na student's Legal Name. However, \nwhenever reasonably possible, a \nstudent's \"Preferred Name\" will be used. \nPlease see registrar.columbia.edu/\ncontent/name-and-address-changes for \nfurther details.\nStudents may change their name of \nrecord by submitting a name change \naffidavit to the Student Service Center. \nAffidavits are available from this office or \nonline at registrar.columbia.edu. \nGRADUATION\nColumbia Engineering awards degrees \nthree times during the year: in February, \nMay, and October.

At Columbia, you are \nexpected to participate in an academic \ncommunity that honors intellectual work \nand respects its origins. The abilities \nto synthesize information and produce \noriginal work are key components in the \nlearning process. As such, a violation \nof academic integrity is one of the most \nserious offenses that one can commit \nat Columbia. If found responsible, \nviolations range from disciplinary \nwarning to expulsion from the University. \nCompromising academic integrity not \nonly jeopardizes a student's academic, \nprofessional, and social development; it \nviolates the standards of our community. \nAs a Columbia student, you are \nresponsible for making informed choices \nwith regard to academic integrity both \ninside and outside of the classroom.\nStudents rarely set out with the \nintent of engaging in violations \nof academic integrity. But classes \nare challenging at Columbia, and \nstudents may find themselves \npressed for time, unprepared for \nan assignment or exam, or feeling \nthat the risk of earning a poor grade \noutweighs the need to be thorough. \nSuch circumstances lead some \nstudents to behave in a manner that \ncompromises the integrity of the \nacademic community, disrespects \ntheir instructors and classmates, and \ndeprives them of an opportunity to \nlearn. Students who find themselves \nin such circumstances should \nimmediately contact their instructor \nand adviser for advice. \nFor undergraduate students, another \nresource is the Academic section of the \nLive Well | Learn Well site at wellbeing.\ncolumbia.edu/resources for Academic \nresources and support.\nThe easiest way to avoid academic \nintegrity issues is to prepare yourself \nas best you can. Below are some basic \nsuggestions to help: \n• Discuss with each of your faculty their \nexpectations for maintaining academic \nintegrity.\n• Understand that you have a student \nresponsibility to uphold academic \nintegrity based on the expectations \noutlined in each of your course syllabi. \n• Understand instructors' criteria for \nacademic integrity and their policies \non citation and group collaboration. \n• Clarify any questions or concerns \nabout assignments with instructors as \nearly as possible.\n• Develop a timeline for drafts and \nfinal edits of assignments and begin \npreparation in advance. \n• Avoid plagiarism: acknowledge \npeople’s opinions and theories by \ncarefully citing their words and always \nindicating sources.\n• Assume that collaboration in the \ncompletion of assignments is \nprohibited unless specified by the \ninstructor.\n• Utilize the campus's resources, \nsuch as the Berick Center for \nStudent Advising, Counseling and \nPsychological Services (CPS), and \nEngineering Student Affairs if feeling \noverwhelmed, burdened or pressured.\n• Attend Academic Integrity workshops \noffered throughout the academic year.\n• If you suspect that an academic \nintegrity violation may have occurred, \nknow that you can talk to your \ninstructor, Advising Dean, Director \nof Academic Integrity, Office of \nEngineering Student Affairs, or the \nStudent Conduct and Community \nStandards Office to report any \nallegations of academic misconduct.\nStudents found responsible of an \nacademic integrity violation may not be \neligible to receive Latin Honors at Class \nDay or ineligible to take on leadership \npositions for a period of time and/or \nother distinctions.\nPlagiarism and  \nAcknowledgment of Sources\nColumbia has always believed that \nwriting effectively is one of the most \nimportant goals a college student \ncan achieve.

While the Internet \ncan provide a wealth of information, \nsources obtained from the web must \nbe properly cited just like any other \nsource. If you are uncertain how to \nproperly cite a source of information \nthat is not your own, whether from \nthe Internet or elsewhere, it is critical \nthat you do not hand in your work \nuntil you have learned the proper way \nto use in-text references, footnotes, \nand bibliographies.

Students \nfound responsible for any violations \nof conduct may be disqualified from \nreceiving Latin Honors or other awards. \nThey may also be disqualified from \nparticipating in internships or other \nleadership roles. The parents or \nguardians of undergraduate students \nmay also be notified in cases of \nreceiving a sanctioned outcome of \nDisciplinary Probation or higher.\nFor more information about the \ndiscipline process for undergraduate \nstudents, please review the Academic \nIntegrity website or Student Conduct \n& Community Standards.
