Jae Woo Lee,https://culpa.info/professor/3509,[COMS W3157] Advanced Programming,"TLDR: I hated pretty much everything about this class, it dried up any passion I had for learning CS, made me lose hope as a student at Columbia, and pushed me to seek therapy. I wish I could say that sentence was a joke or an exaggeration, but it was the literal truth. I switched to a different major after this course. This is not because this class is a weed-out (every one passes if you don’t cheat). Rather, it’s the soul-sucking, inhumane, pedagogical vileness and borderline insanity that occupies the mind of one Jae Woo Lee that pushed me away from this course and major, and he’s a nice guy too so imagine that. More comprehensive review: Jae's philosophy is essentially: if you try, you'll learn a lot. What this does not mean: 1) you will do well on exams 2) you will do well on labs 3) content will click immediately. In fact, it's quite the opposite. It is through the grueling intensity of this course's homework and the monumental challenges that are the exams that the fundamental material of this course will be cemented into your brain by the end of it (provided you don't cheat and pay attention). You will understand how a computer works (at the surface level at least); you will be able to work with a large pre-written codebase; you will be prepared for higher level systems and database courses. These are the central assertions that Jae makes in the first lecture and then rigorously proves over the course. However, will you end up liking CS after this course? For many, I don't think so. Understanding and learning a lot does not equate to enjoyment. The massive influx of knowledge you get from this course comes at the cost of your passion for CS drying up. Jae will contest this. In fact, the paper he published (and continues to promote) about this course has (carefully selected) reviews of students who took his course and developed a newfound passion for CS that they did not get from data structures and 1004/1006/1002. One example includes a physics student who switched to CS after taking AP and then ended up getting a PhD in the subject from a top university. This entire paper is predicated on flawed reasoning (pretty typical for STEM professors attempting sociological research): that people study computer science because they like computer science. Most don't. Most saw TikToks about the 150k+ salary that software engineers make and decided to enroll in Intro-to-Java. Most see the degree as a means to an end (a job). A minority probably like systems as a subject (they'll end up taking OS or becoming TAs), but do not *DELUDE* yourself that this course is going to make you like CS if you view this degree as a path to an engineering job at some tech company. When this course is over, you will be relieved, so relieved as to the point that you might elicit a tear or two that it’s finally over. You survived the war. The finish-line. You made it. Then, whether or not you have a brain, you’ll either take more courses with Jae or move onto better professors. Is C + UNIX programming useful? No! Jae admits this in lecture 1. What you actually learn from this course is less about C and more about a) how a computer works and the internal memory processes behind it, b) the basics of OS, and c) how to practice iterative development. Teaching C and UNIX is simply a vessel to that end. Some niche advice: Don't fall into the cult of personality surrounding Jae. He's a nice guy, but he isn't divine when it comes to CS education. He will try to justify AP’s structure and workload off of a paper he wrote in 2011; he will cite articles on his webpage about how Bwog considers AP one of the best classes at Columbia; he will crack a joke or two about his past life as a developer. Do not fall into this trap that you must take more courses with him. LEAVE. As that guy in Get Out said, GET OUT! Here are some immediate red flags that should tell you to leave: - In the first lecture, he led with “you’ve probably read some bad reviews about me.” - “You might not do well even if you try hard” - a quote from his syllabus powerpoint. - He beefed with Hillary Clinton over some blackboards. Remember the last guy who publicly beefed with Hillary Clinton? Look what happened to him. - He continuously has to justify the difficulty of his course (mostly after every exam or an exceptionally hard homework) by citing papers he wrote, carefully selected student reviews. - About 15 minutes before the second midterm, he emailed the entire class listserv a screenshot of text messages with his OWN SON who was taking AP as well. In these messages, his son was lamenting about how hard one of the practice exams were. After this screenshot, Jae wrote a “good luck” message and signed off on the email. Diving into the thought process by this psychotic action, he probably wanted to convey “hey even my own son thinks my course is hard. Don’t worry about that much.” What it ended up coming off as was “hah lol my son is struggling with exams I WROTE lemme expose him to a group of 650 classmates.” This course is a hurdle that every CS major has to get through. Climb, fumble, collapse, or jump effortlessly over this hurdle and do not look back! On the bright side, I know entire friend groups that formed during AP over the sheer collective trauma. You will leave this course with some new comrades to swap war stories with over a couple of cigars. You’ll never see CS majors be more social than when the AP Lab is due. To finish off this review, I'll leave a quote from his first lecture powerpoint: ""Please don’t get stressed out about AP."" I did."
Jae Woo Lee,https://culpa.info/professor/3509,[COMS W3157] Advanced Programming,"Jae is a God. No, not just a god, he is a Three-Wolf-Moon shirt on steroids. Not only does he know his stuff, he knows how to teach it. Granted, this was the hardest class I'd ever taken in my life, but the long hours of work and sleepless nights have made me into a better programmer and students. There is a reason as to why people were basically begging him to revive the Data Structures in C class and teach it also; he was just *that* good. The classes were engaging, he would answer any question and repeat things as necessary, and really wanted to stress it all so we would understand, even if we had to go through it multiple times. The most lovely thing about this class is the listserv; through email, all students in the class could give advice and help each other on the homework (code-free of course!). Writing your own web server was daunting but once you're done, you'll be amazed at what you've been able to accomplish. He is professor material, for sure. Columbia, be smart and make him a prof with automatic tenure; our Computer Science department needs more wonderful people like him."
Jae Woo Lee,https://culpa.info/professor/3509,[COMS W3157] Advanced Programming,"I stepped into 3157 with the same fear as everyone else. I walked out with a stack of knowledge, countless tricks, and... still a lingering fear. It was an intense course, but with the right approach, it’s more than manageable. Content: Yes. Jae is *that* good. You've probably heard some horror stories—and I can confirm them—but his course design and lectures are truly exceptional. In the end, - You will learn a lot about C - You will build a solid foundation in Git and UNIX - You will be a very careful coder, thanks to his harsh grading :( Are these useful? Not always, but think of it as a workout on your programming habit and attitude. ---------- Survival tips - Attend lectures in-person, and take good notes - Join Section 2 for extra help—it's where Jae shows his nice side (yes, it exists) - Do the practice exams and review solutions carefully - Start the labs EARLY. Debugging under pressure is not a fun sport. - The TAs and ListServ are incredibly helpful!"
Jae Woo Lee,https://culpa.info/professor/3509,[COMS W3157] Advanced Programming,"This class is INFAMOUS so you’ll go in scared. Jae will scare you a little more. Eventually, you’ll learn that it’s really not that bad but the tests are pretty deadly (do all 4 practice tests he provides and watch/attend all the TA review sessions. Go to class. This semester, like every other semester, there was a bit cheating scandal. A lot of people cheat and some of them get caught and threatened with disciplinary action."
Jae Woo Lee,https://culpa.info/professor/3509,[COMS W3157] Advanced Programming,"As someone who got a 92% raw score (before curve)... I literally had nightmares about this class before I took it, but it was really not that bad. The fearmongering about this course is INSANE and if you tell yourself the course is hard, it's only gonna make it harder for you. Yes, AP is a tough class, but if you put in genuine effort, you will be just fine! As with any course that is curved, you just have to do around average, so just make it your goal to score approx average on the HWs and exams. If you lower the bar, you'll be less stressed and score better. A lot of people say this course is useless. If you are a diehard SWE person, then you will also probably think it's useless. But, what many may not know is that a lot of roles want you to have a good understanding of basic networking, and that is exactly what AP teaches. How to do well: -Show up to lectures. IN PERSON. Pay attention. So many people make the mistake of ""I'll just watch it later"". -If you don't understand something, ask for clarification IMMEDIATELY, either with classmates, TAs, or even Jae himself! -My most important tip: diagram/draft out the HWs ON PAPER before coding. HW6 (the second-hardest HW) took me only 2 hours to do because I wrote it all down on paper beforehand. If the paper version makes no sense, or if you don't even know how to start, go to the TAs and they will walk you through what to do. -To study for the exams, just do the practice exams over and over until you get nearly 100% on all of them. That's literally all I did to prepare. And yes, the exams don't always look like the practice, but if you do the practice exams, the actual exam will go way better for you. -Find a TA you like, and go to their OH every week. Make it a habit to go over content with them and ask them even the ""stupidest"" of questions. -DO NOT DROP LAB7. It will bomb your grade. I swear if you follow my advice above YOU WILL DO WELL. AP rewards attention to detail, hard work, and most importantly honesty. Like do not cheat. They will find you. My grade breakdown: Midterm 1: slightly below average Midterm 2: exactly average Final: 20% above average HW (with lowest dropped): considerably above average TL;DR: Just put in your best effort and ask questions. You will be fine."
Jae Woo Lee,https://culpa.info/professor/3509,[COMS W3157] Advanced Programming,"People hype up this class and fear monger so much, and half of the stress of the class comes from that. Jae is a great teacher and his lectures are coherent, easy to follow, and relevant. He often gives extra help for labs in recitations and everything is recorded. The practice exams are really helpful and his exams are pretty fair, although very hard. You have to really know everything and understand to the finest detail. Be prepared to revolve your life around this class if you want to do well and put in 100% AUTHENTIC work. This is NOT a class you can cut corners in and if you think you can, you will find out quickly you cannot."
Jae Woo Lee,https://culpa.info/professor/3509,[COMS W3157] Advanced Programming,"I was really afraid of taking Advanced Programming due to the fearmongering, so much so that I dropped a course just so that I could focus on AP. One important thing to note is that we are in Columbia University, where people start tweaking out over an A-, meaning that a good chunk of the comments about courses can sometimes be blown out of proportion. That being said, while AP is definitely not an easy class, I would not really rate it as impossible, considering a lot of people do fairly well. I agree with most reviews here that Jae is a great lecturer and he can explain concepts very easily in his lectures. As for the content of the class, on the surface level, while the majority of the ideas taught in class are straightforward, they are prone to becoming really tricky really fast. In other words, you are expected to 100% understand a concept in order to do well in the exams. This is a really demanding class, and people do well only if they put in the effort."
